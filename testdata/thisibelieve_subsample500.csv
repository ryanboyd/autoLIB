000349.txt,Bets Parker,,65+,"Danville, Vermont","March 29, 2005",2005,This I Believe,love;setbacks,"I grew up in New York City during the Great Depression.  It was a tough time for everyone, and not a time when a child could feel secure.  My father left home when I was two.  My mother was constantly worried,  I coped by creating for myself an ideal family life – in my imagination.  Another way was to seek out friends who lived in the sort of family that I craved for myself.
     I was surrounded by books and from them I found the elements of a belief system, but I needed a structure for it. When I was about ten, I found a church, not far from where we lived.  I went there every Sunday by myself.  (My mother was amused by my determination, but offered no objections.)
     When I was fourteen, I was sent to an Anglican boarding school in Canada, where I was confirmed by the Bishop of Quebec.  That was a solemn and moving expereince for me, and it gave me a new kind of confidence as I moved through high school and college.
    I went out into the world, clutching my faith within me, but meeting and getting to know others of many faiths.  I came to understand that what really mattered was not the structure of belief but the knowledge that all of us are imoprtant, all children of some kind of God and in need of love.  The faith I had found filled the insecurity and emptiness in me and freed me to move outside of myself and love wholeheartedly.
    I found out that I looked for good in people and responded to it.  I learned some things about love from special teachers and friends.  Then, later, in the experiences of marriage and parenthood I found and believed strongly in the working of love that ocould survive deep sorrow and troubled times and the continuing challenges of life.
    The strongest test of my faith came in 1995 when my beloved only daughter died of a massive brain hemorrhage, following what was expected to be the uncomplicated removal of an aneurysm.  It was indeed a fearful time.  Through the dark days of my pain and shock, I began to feel a strength within me, bolstered by the support of family, friends and church.  I knew that I had to call on my belief system to get me through the effects of this great loss.  I had not only my own emotional survival to deal with, but alos I felt deep within myself that I wanted to reach out to help others – those who loved my daughter and those I might be able to help in the future by sharing my pain and my survival.
    Along the way, I wrote and published a poem about my experience, which has actually been helpful to quite a few people.  So, in fact, my belief has become not just a prop for me, but also a contribution to the healing process of others around me.

000794.txt,Mary Pat,,50 - 65,"Iowa City, Iowa","April 7, 2005",2005,This I Believe,,"This I Believe
I grew up very Catholic, attending 16 years of parochial schools, often going to daily Mass. In high school I was the prefect of our sodality – the Queen of the May. The caption under my graduation picture was ""Our perfect prefect."" Around the age of 25 I found myself searching to find a Catholic Church that fit my changing focus – a focus that was becoming more and more blurred. Not finding one, I could not make myself continue.
I miss the culture, the traditions, the comfort, and the certainty of my early Catholic faith. I don't like not believing. I like the idea of a personal God, one who attends to my every prayer, my every need.   
I believe we create our archetypes and Jesus Christ is one of them — this perfect model to help us become as He — Sons of God. I cannot view it literally, but the symbols and the metaphors hold great power for me. 
I believe that God (of whatever name) is within us – that the real message is we are meant to BE God. I believe we are meant to live with divine purpose and to continually strive for that end. At the highest level I believe we are all One — and that in serving humanity we serve ourselves. This service takes many forms. It means doing good work by making whatever work we do good and with the intention of serving the Common Good. It means treating others the way we wish to be treated. ""What you do unto those, the least of my brethren, you do unto me."" ""Love thy neighbor as thyself."" ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" ""Judge not lest thee be judged."" ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."" And, the hardest of all, ""Love thy enemies."" 
It means making tough choices when we can't have it all — like agreeing to tax increases for those of us who are more advantaged to provide better services and opportunities for the poor and disadvantaged. It means cleaning up messes wherever we find them. It means investing the resources and doing the work to care for all of nature as well as all humanity. I believe this love and appreciation for nature and people opens us to enjoy life to its fullest. I believe what goes around comes around at some mysterious metaphysical level.
As human beings we are fallible, weak, and ""see through a glass darkly."" If only we could remember that as we impose our judgments and beliefs on others. 
My belief does not stem from a dogma or a religion. I don't know how we got here or where we're going. The only thing I feel strongly is that there is something very profound and sacred within our souls. It's our job to find our God within and do the best we can with whatever we've been given — to be good stewards with our lives and with this earth. We may have to keep coming back until we get it right — assuming there's anything left.

I believe that throughout humanity as a whole, our similarities greatly outweigh our differences. Being only 23 years old and having never lived outside of my native West Virginia, I had no idea of what to expect when I took a job teaching English in Valladolid, Spain.  I had gotten my bachelor's degree in Spanish from WVU in Morgantown, and had taught a couple of classes as a grad student.  It wasn't the language difference or the responsibility of teaching that filled my thoughts on my first journey away from North America.  It was a fear of somehow being inherently different. I couldn't explain it, but I tried to research as much as possible to keep my imaginary fears from becoming realities.  
I spoke to many of my family, friends and fellow students about how to ""fit in.""  I received a barrage of advice.  For example, I was told not to wear white socks, not to wear any of my WVU t-shirts, not to frequent places associated with Americans like Mc Donald's.  I was told to steer clear of hanging out with other Americans and to keep quiet about my own nationality as much as possible.  For some reason or another, this series of helpful hints didn't sit well with me.  Was I really going to have to go to all this trouble to live in Europe?  Couldn't I just be the same guy that I had always been?  
Right before I left I had a dinner with one of the professors from my department. During this meeting I received the best advice about living abroad and life in general. ""Be you, dress like yourself, act like yourself, and the rest will follow,"" was his advice to me.  At that point I wasn't sure what to think or who to believe.  I was too busy packing everything that I would need for my year stay in Spain and worrying about boarding and flying on only the third airplane in my life (the first two only being puddle jumpers between West Virginia, Washington D.C., and Kentucky) 
When I arrived in Spain I was jetlagged, disoriented, and generally overwhelmed.  The long trip through customs, the train stations, and locating my new apartment complex was a blurry haze.  Once I arrived and got settled in I was forced to decide whose advice to follow.  Should I change my white socks, avoid the Americans, and avoid talking about my nationality?  Or should I put on a Mountaineer t-shirt, present myself as who I am, and invite my new friends out for an ice-cold beer (be them whichever nationality)?
Well, after phrasing that question to myself in those words, it didn't take long to realize what the answer should be.  I took the advice of my professor and as Robert Frost once said, ""and that has made all the difference.""  I found out that my new friends were American, Spanish, Indonesian, French, Irish and we all wore white socks, went to McDonalds, and were ourselves.

001525.txt,Tim,,30 - 50,"Gainesville, Florida","April 25, 2005",2005,This I Believe,goodness & kindness;tolerance,"If you've ever taken a freshman philosophy course, you've wrestled with Bishop Berkeley, who presented us with the disturbing notion that the world exists only in our heads. Berkeley argued, quite convincingly, that you can't prove your bed exists unless you actually in the bedroom observing it. You can't know a train has wheels if you're sitting inside it. And you can't prove to me that you exist, except as a thought in my mind. It's an unsettling, exasperating idea, and it's probably one reason why some people bolt out of the room when a conversation takes a turn toward the philosophical.
I'm more of those people who never quite got over Intro to Philosophy. I don't believe in much of anything — not fate, not God, not an afterlife. But there are a few things I accept as articles of faith, even though I can't prove them. I believe there is an objective world, full of beds and train wheels that I cannot see right now. I believe this world is full of people who are every bit as real as I am, and every bit as important. And I believe that my actions have an effect on the people around me, so I must do what I can to help them, or at least not harm them. 
I believe that these items of faith are the real foundation of morality — not just for me, but for people of all philosophical stripes. You can believe in any collection of gods and angels, or none at all, but if you're doing good in the world, it's because you believe that people matter and you can help them. And if you're doing wrong, it's because, at some point, you were able to convince yourself that other people aren't as real as you are, or that they would come to harm no matter what you do.
Because I hold so few things as items of faith, people sometimes accuse me of believing in nothing at all. But it's the most modest moral claims that are the strongest, and demand the most of us. These days, it's particularly hard for me to live with the notion that my actions affect others, and can make a difference. In a time when wars and torture go on without popular consent even in the most democratic countries, it's tough for me to figure out what I can do to stop my own government from harming people far from home. My plan is to do what people of faith have always done: keep plugging away at problems close at hand, and keep watching for the chance to make a larger change in the world.

001968.txt,Nikki,,30 - 50,"Belton, Missouri","May 6, 2005",2005,This I Believe,parenthood,"I believe in the biology of Motherhood.  This is a new revelation for me.  I always assumed I would have children someday, but found myself married five years and in no real hurry.  Now you have to understand, I am a dooms-day, glass is half empty, worrying type.  I am also very practical, no-nonsense and analytical, so becoming a mother would be an active decision considered from all angles. I decided it was time to begin the investigation.
Knowing the probable outcome, I began a full analysis anyway.  Of course my husband and I discussed it at length. We just couldn't understand what the payoff was in a scenario where complete dependency turned into teen angst and rebellion. Ultimately, there is no guarantee that your children will want anything to do with you as adults – or that you will even like them for that matter. Sounded like a set up for disappointment to me.
Then the interviews began. I talked to everyone I knew with kids and without, with babies, with teenagers and even some women far removed from their child-bearing years who could reflect on their decisions. I made a pros and cons list.  
The cons list was very long.  Beyond the obvious things like lifestyle change, loss of certain freedoms and a lower probability of early retirement, many of my cons were fear based.  What if something was wrong with the baby?  What if something tragic happened over the next 18 years to my child?  I thought about household accidents, car wrecks and drunk driving teenagers.  I thought about illness and any scenario beyond my control that would cause fear or pain, heartache or disappointment.  
The pros list was very short. Nothing more that selfish immortality and the alleviation of the fear that I would look back at 50, regret my decision, and know that it was too late.  I imagined looking at my husband after years of travel, a beautiful home, and everything we ever wanted and finding ourselves bored silly and wondering what we missed.  
Now, don't get me wrong, I knew there were more pros.  I had conducted interviews, and all the parents talked about the intangible joys.  Their comments were so consistent, they made me believe every clichT I've ever hear about parenthood. I had faith in the pros, but knew I'd never really understand them unless I experienced them for my self.
So we did it, just as I knew we would, and it happened right away.  Pregnancy brought an unexpected side effect I can only attribute to the biology of motherhood. For the first time that I can remember, I was not worried. I was completely anxiety free – knowing full well that I had no idea of what lay ahead. I was not worried about the pregnancy or the health of the baby. I did not wonder if I would be a good mother or if my husband and I would get it right. In the matter of becoming a family, only the biology of motherhood could explain the peace, contentment and newfound patience inside me that continues to this day. 
Our little boy is seven months old now and completely amazing. He is named after his grandfathers. Each night I go into his room and put my hand on his tummy just to feel him breathe. As I watch him sleep, my heart fills and aches with a love for which I can not find the words. And to my delight, I hear it just keeps getting better and better. 
My pros list is now infinite and all the cons have evaporated. Reviewing the list, each one is acknowledged and dismissed (sometimes with a chuckle). I was clearly trying to protect myself from the possible heartache of living my life, when a single smile from my son makes my life worth living. The sheer joy of having this child in our lives makes all those fear and concerns seem insignificant. That's the biology of motherhood. 
Every clichT is true, and yes, I think we'll have one more.

002388.txt,Wes,,18 - 30,"Tarrytown, New York","May 17, 2005",2005,When the Shouting Stops,self-knowledge,"When the Shouting Stops
It may seem like a simple thing, but I believe the world and everyone in it would be much happier if they stopped yelling and shouting.
I remember the exact day I accepted this as an absolute truth. I was 16 and had a fairly typical teenage-parent relationship with my father that was mostly defined by me wanting to do things and him telling me I couldn't. These conflicts almost always played out in shouting matches that rarely if ever resolved the issue. He'd yell, I'd yell, and we'd still end up back at our initial impasse. 
Then I read an article talking about human relationships, communication, and conflict. The article said that when people are being yelled at they cease to listen.  They'd mostly just wait for their turn to yell back. The article went on to say that without listening there could be no compromise, no resolution and no reconciliation. 
I realized that the phenomenon it discussed was exactly what I went through with my father on almost a daily basis. I realized that until we lowered our voices we would never be able to properly communicate, resolve conflicts, or realize the full potential of our love and friendship for each other.
Armed with this information and a good dose of youthful righteous indignation, I right then and there marched into my father's room and boldly gave him notice that from now on I would no longer listen to a word he had to say if he yelled at me. Likewise I didn't expect him to listen to a word I had to say if I was yelling. I told him that he didn't yell at his co-workers and I didn't yell at my classmates, so why should we treat each other with any less respect than we would those relative strangers. If he wanted me to be an adult, he needed to treat me like an adult and act like one himself. 
At first he was angry at my boldness. In a familiar pattern he raised his voice and started shouting. The difference was that this time I didn't shout back, and instead I simply left the room. The next day we talked again and he apologized for his outburst the night before. He admitted the way we had been going about things as wrong and at that moment we made a pact to work as hard as we could to keep our voices down and work things out like sane, calm, adults. 
From that day on my relationship with my father blossomed into one of the most rewarding, loving and happy bonds that I've ever known. He's one of the first people I turn to when I need someone to understand and support me. I chose him above many good friends to be the best man in my wedding. I admire and look up to him more than any man I've ever known. I can't imagine where we'd be if the shouting hadn't died down.

	I recently ran into my uncle at a family reunion and discovered him to be wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with the racist logo of the Cleveland Indians. I proceeded to question my newly emigrated uncle how he would feel if someone named a baseball team the San Francisco Chinamen and adorned a cap with an image of an old fashion caricature of a smiling Chinese man with slanted eyes wearing a Sampan hat. I thought he would be able to understand my analogy but instead he simply brushed off the notion and moved onto another helping of egg rolls. 
	On the way home from the gathering, I began to realize my uncle's nanvetT was embolic of the future of an America that welcomed many adult TmigrTs. My uncle, like many adult immigrants did not have the privilege to grow up in the American education system therefore he never had the opportunity to learn about America's racist past and the attached feeling of atonement that came with that lesson. My uncle and other immigrants of his generation have also come to America in an era, post civil rights when the blatancy of racism is not as readily overt as it was for those Chinese who had emigrated prior to President Johnson signing the Immigration Act of 1965. You see, after President Johnson signed the Immigration Act of 1965, the act that significantly shifted immigration from mostly European to non-European nations, Asians and other non-Caucasian Americans became standard, no longer a novelty. Once the flood of such diverse ethnicities began to change America, Caucasians had to find contentment and then a new appreciation for the changing American landscape. 
	The bitter irony of America in 2005 is that many of my closest Caucasian friends are far more colorblind than many of my immigrants relatives that would fall into the category of minority. However, understand this does not mean that my relatives are necessarily more race conscious then my Caucasian friends. It is just that my relatives did not grow up with the baggage many in White America have had to carry for the past sins of intolerance that many but not all of their parents and grandparents should be held accountable for. Do I think it is fair that the sins of the few mar and taint their descendants who had nothing to do with propagating hate? Of course not but I also see this as a positive thing for White America. I believe Caucasians are blessed to have that stigma to carry. It is the consciousness of that stigma that not only prevents us from repeating the sins of the past but also allows us to have empathy for causes that others might not relate to such as racist Native American caricatures that adorn our sports memorabilia.

002955.txt,Adria,,18 - 30,"Portland, Oregon","May 27, 2005",2005,This I Believe,immigrant,"Living  in the Circle
	I believe life is a circle.  My grandmother is responsible for teaching me that.  At 85, her abdomen became consumed with cancer.  The surgeon, who operated on her,  cried when he gave the news to my mother.  A week later, I took her home.  As I nervously accepted the morphine and other supplies from the discharge nurses, I wondered if I was about to make a grave mistake with her health, like overdosing her on morphine.  But the nurses assured me nothing I could do would cause a problem for her.  They definitely did not expect her to live much longer!
	Once I had her settled in her bed, set up in the middle of the living room, I sat with her as she ate the dinner I had prepared.  After she finished she said her in broken English, ""Maybe I sucha problem for you?"". 
	 ""Why?"", I replied in shock.  ""Who changed my diapers when I was little?  Who spent hours in the kitchen daily, regularly cooking my favorite foods?.  Nonna, I don't mind at all.""  She reached for my hand, squeezed it, and smiled with relief.  
	The next day I gave her a bath.  She held on to me, afraid of slipping, as I guided her into the tub.  As I bathed her, I thought about how this must be what it is like to be a parent.  When your children are scared, you calm and reassure them.  They trust you.  I remember all the baths I took in that tub as a little girl.  My grandmother would say I was her pescelino, her little fish,  because I splashed so much.   I have definitely always loved water. 
	When my grandmother became sick that summer, I moved in with her and began a different life…I lived part of her life.  At night, when she could not sleep, I would ask her about her life, what it was like to come to the United States alone as a single woman.  Many of the events she described occurred between 1950 and 1970 before I was even born.  However, it is amazing how my grandmother's life and mine are intertwined like ivy creeping up a wall, always reaching higher, always wanting more.  The vines branch off in somewhat different directions, but their nourishment and strength come from the same roots.  
	I believe our lives do not completely belong to us.  Pieces of them belong to our ancestors who came before us, those who will come after us, and the people we live and work with every day.  When at 26, I decided to pursue a doctoral degree, I remembered my mother who worked two jobs and ran a ranch by herself.  During those years I learned to cook, do laundry, stack wood, get my homework done, and solve my own problems.   I knew I could work full time and go to school part time, after all I was taught to work hard.  When I wanted to give up classes at the university because of all the sacrifices involved in working full time and going to school, I remembered my grandmother and the day she cried and cried when her father told her she would not be returning to school for the fourth grade.  So, I stayed in school.  
	When more than one relative advised me not to go into public school teaching, but to use my master's degree in another higher-paying career, I remembered my grandfather.  When the factory he worked for began severely polluting the town, he began taking air samples in the middle of the night and then reported the company to state air quality officials.  When action did not come as quickly as he felt necessary, he circulated a petition.  The company was forced to make adjustments to their smokestacks to make them pollute less.  That was during the 1970s.  However, the company continued to pollute the community's air, water, and soil in other ways.
	In 1983, my mother reported the company to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which eventually designated it as Superfund Toxic Site.  Sadly, however, when the EPA first met with community members and workers from the factory many of them said to leave the company alone because they needed their jobs and ""didn't want to cause trouble"".  Many explained all they had was a high school education and did not expect to find other work in an area that offered few alternatives regardless of one's educational obtainment.  The company ended up downsizing later anyway, but the damage was already done.  People in their 30s and 40s began dying of cancer to such an extent that a cancer research center was opened up in a nearby town of only 7, 000 people.
	Later on in my early twenties when I developed health problems of my own due to exorbitant amount of toxins in my system, I was once again reminded my life is not my own.  Strangers, thirty years previously, had decided for me that I would drink arsenic-laced water, eat food grown from dioxin-contaminated soil, and breathe creosote-related compounds into my lungs as I played in our backyard, only a block away from the factory.  What if the community as a whole had been social activists, unafraid of taking action?  What if most of them had more than a high school education and could therefore move to other towns and get better work, putting them in a more secure position to fight the factory pollution?  What if my grandfather and mother had not stood up to the factory owners who had eventually been made to clean up their waste?  Would I be dead by 40?  
	I have benefited enormously from the sacrifices people have made on my behalf.  Now, I stand for others.  As you may have guessed, I do not work in business, nor do I get paid what I am worth.  I obtained a teaching position at a high-poverty school, specifically choosing it so I could work with English Language Learners.  It has been a struggle since the day I began working there.  Once individuals have been taught they are  worth less than someone else, many of them self-destruct.  They are part of a cycle that is extremely difficult to break.  Have you ever looked into the eyes of a thirteen-year old who believes he or she is hopeless, that there is not even a point in trying to do well in school?  I have, and I realize those eyes could have belonged to me if it were not for my family.  So I have embarked on a mission to inspire my students to believe in themselves.  Sometimes I fail and question why I stay, why I keep trying.  Other times I know I have impacted a child's life forever because he or she has learned to try, to hope, to believe there is a future out there that belongs to him or her.  It is said a Mexican Revolutionary scrawled the following in his own blood on a Cuernavaca wall, ""It is better to die on your feet, than to live on your knees.""  No one  should have to live on their knees.

003446.txt,Tiffany,,Under 18,"Palo Alto, California","June 10, 2005",2005,This I Believe,family;values & spirituality,"THIS I BELIVE 
My personal beliefs and morals have teeter-tottered on the edge of a very difficult and confusing path.  It is a path that all teenagers face at sometime in their life, where they must sort out what they believe and how they should live, among the influence of those around them.   Between religion, parents, peers, the media, and other influences, one must learn to figure out which values they will hold to, establishing their life's paths.
For me this choice came early in my freshman year of high school.   I realized that the friends I had spent much time with were not the kinds of people whom I wanted to base my values on.  Although it seemed very hard at the time, I was able to leave those friends in order to find a better influence.   I did find a new circle of friends, however.  This time it took me two years to again realize that they were not the friends I truly wanted to surround myself with.   Since friends in high school have such an impact on your life, they can help you either ""make it or break it,"" and they can truly help shape the person that you eventually become.
My parents' views, however, are based almost solely on our family's religious beliefs.   My parents are role model-citizens, who attend P.T.A. meetings for my siblings and me, attend church each Sunday for 3 hours, and pay 10% of their gross income to a charitable organization each month.   While my parents are living a modest and conservative lifestyle, many of my peers go out at night to wild parties, using fake ID's to get into adult only clubs, and steal things, along with others, who are using substances such as marijuana, and strong alcohol for what they consider ""a fun time"".
I admit it took me quite awhile before I came to find my own belief system.  Unfortunately though, since I'm seventeen years old and live at home, I am required to abide by my parent's moral values.   But, despite my limitations due to parental authority, I have chosen to drink caffeineated drinks on occasion, which my parents would strongly disagree with if they, by chance, read this essay.  I find that drinking a drink that contains caffeine helps me focus in school and keep me alert while driving.   Although I have chosen to oppose my parent's value, and go down this specific route of occasional caffeine drinking, I have, nevertheless, encompassed many other values that I've learned from my parents.  For example, I have decided that the extremely conservative dating restrictions that my parents require me to follow is a value that I intend to continue implementing in my life, which is contrary to the behaviors that some of my peers may want me to succumb to.   
Through my short, yet philosophical life, I have been confronted with many difficult decisions and have been able to rise above my hardships by making choices that I can stand by and feel assured that I have chosen the right way to live.   For me, choosing the right way to govern my life is what will in the long run, make me truly happy, and let's face it, isn't that what everyone is striving for?

Life is too short to live each day as though it were just another day. The recent event that challenged that idea for me was my near-death experience one November morning at six o'clock. It was cold and pitch black outside with only the light from the moon. All I wanted to do was drive. I was attending the University of Maryland-College Park. I was packing up my car, which was parked parallel on the road, for a trip to visit my boyfriend at Virginia Tech. He had recently received word that he was leaving for Afghanistan with the Army for a year. I was an emotional wreck. 
As I was standing next to my little, blue Neon putting luggage in my car, I noticed a person had started their vehicle up the way and turned on the headlights. There was a stop sign up the road, so I knew I had a few seconds to get out of way before the vehicle would pass. Next thing I knew, the manual car was speed shifting, or racing down the road, already in fourth gear, bypassing the stop sign. The vehicle was coming in such a way that my car door was open to the on-coming vehicle.  In those final few seconds, I tucked myself between the little half metal door as much as possible while the vehicle at the last second swerved in my direction. Coming straight for me were two, bright white ""eyes."" All I could do was wait for the impact. One, two, three, four…
Then, the enormous metal monster hit.  CRASH! 
My body was smashed between my car door and the oncoming vehicle. The impact of the crash hit my door so that fortunately my car door closed on me instead of opened, therefore not leaving my legs vulnerable to the metal monster.  I had been blessed, bruised, but blessed. I was given a second chance at making my life even more effective. 
The car proceeded to scrape up against the entire side of my car. It continued down the road: a hit and run. I was left shaking.  I was unsure of how I had lived through that ordeal. I was standing alone with the horrible, vivid memory of what happened and the mystery vehicle's right side view mirror as evidence. Even now, as I type the event out on the computer, my fingers start to shake. That moment in time changed my life forever. 
Later that day I found out the man had been drinking and there were open beer cans in the vehicle. The police had found the vehicle, impounded it, but still had no evidence on who had caused me to forever live with that horrific memory.  Since I had not physically seen the person, they did little to assure me they would find the man.  They left out on their police report the entire part of beer cans being in the vehicle and me standing next to my car during the whole nightmare event.  To this day I am uncertain if the man will be charged correctly for his crime.
Although I may never know what happened to that person, I know that through the incident I do not live a day anymore as though it were just another day. Each day for me, is lived out to its fullest. What more can I accomplish? What more can I gain in knowledge? How can I affect other peoples' lives in a positive way? What new trades can I learn?  I take every day that I am given on earth and make the best of it.  
As country singer Martina McBride would say, ""I Have Been Blessed.""  Many people may not understand why I attempt to find good in that experience, but I believe it is important to try. I believe each day is another day I have been blessed with by God.

I believe in my students writing an independent newspaper and I believe in the homeless woman downtown shouting into a microphone. I also believe in the old man picketing a used-car dealership. 
Back in college, I remember feeling aimless. I idolized heroes from my parent's generation and felt out of touch with my own. There seemed to be no more worthy causes for which to fight. Then a friend took me to protest something called apartheid. My first political rally, I learned about injustice and cruelty an ocean away. Suddenly the appropriate movement presented itself.
I hosted fundraisers and gathered signatures urging businesses to divest from South Africa. I held signs outside such companies, yelling with friends that violating human rights would no longer be tolerated. I spent hours phoning radio stations berating musicians who still played Sun City. My car looked like a moving billboard with multiple bumper stickers calling for an end to legalized racism. Then something remarkable happened. Nelson Mandela was released from prison and the dismantling of apartheid laws began. 
I helped make apartheid history. I did it – along with concerned citizens from all over the world. Oh, victory tasted sweeter than cynicism! I was hooked. 
I organized boycotts against corporations testing cosmetics on animals and protested supermarkets that carried such products. It wasn't long before labels became popular that promised ""No Animal Testing"". Soon after, I campaigned for a progressive Southern governor who wanted to be President of the United States. Young people came out to vote in record numbers and Bill Clinton was sworn into office. Afterward, I rallied for laws that made it easier for people to stay home with sick family members or register to vote while picking up a driver's license. I felt proud and important. It was a good time to be idealistic.
A wise woman once said I would learn more from defeat than victory. I've learned much from both and while the last few years have been challenging, I am more optimistic than ever about the role we play in our evolving planet. At a young and impressionable age, I experienced firsthand the power of the people. I will never forget it. And I will never stop believing that I can change the world. You can, too. My students and the homeless woman and the old man as well. We all make a difference.
Believe it.

While still in the hospital they told me how to hold my baby, how to feed my baby and how often to feed her. What they didn't tell me was the fundamental responsibilities of raising this baby to become a productive, well adjusted member of society. Nor did they mention anything about mastering the art of deontology. And 18 years later– I know why, they simply didn't know either. How easy a parent's job would be if raising children were black and white, but to be a great parent, a truly dedicated parent… I had to spend most of my time in the gray areas. I am a single Mother of six children ranging in age from 4 all the way to 18. And I believe that with each birth I was given a gift, I'm talking about extraordinary gifts that I now know were not given to every new Mother. In no significant order– with baby number one came the strength to want to be a great mother. Baby number 2 brought the will to see it through; with my third child I received the gift of insight. Bundle of joy number four brought desire and with babies five and six I received the gifts of courage and determination. 
As invaluable as the precious gifts were to me– half way through it all I realized I had a knack for child rearing and surprised myself when I realized I was pretty good at it. My true strength lies in my determination and refusal to watch my children become statistics. My children are not genetically, environmentally or socially predisposed to negative social behaviors; like society dictates. Rather, my children are and will be products of my moral obligations. I teach my children exactly what I want them to learn and specifically what I don't. I can recall the days when I would say to my kids: ""I didn't raise you to do that."" Although true enough I didn't. What I did do was forget to teach them not to. That has to be the most essential parenting lesson I've ever learned, just because I didn't specifically teach my child to steal or lie– is no way an indication that they knew not to.
I always swore I would never be one of those parents who lay blame on music, video games, the media or even peers pressures the minute there child shows the slightest display of negative or criminal behaviors. These are my children and they are my responsibility and the choices they make and the paths they choose will be because I, not society, have supplied them with the knowledge and tools they'll need to form their own distinctions between what is right and what is wrong.  It absolutely does not take a village to raise a child– it only takes the diligence of one ethically responsible parent. This I believe with all my heart because I am such a parent– just doing my job.

Also, if available, I believe in a deck poised before green infinity, a pot of tea, rosemary toast topped with butter and honey, and a favorite soul to share it with. My friend Lori taught me this. One early summer morning, before it got too hot, she snuck the accoutrements onto a small table at tree level while my back was turned. 
She was carrying excess weight and a puffy face from drugs that stole her sleep. Her feet and hands were numb and she was harassed by headaches. I had begun to question the therapeutic nature of chemotherapy. Despite her pain and my best efforts, Lori insisted sometimes, on doing for herself. That morning she did for me.
Such a breakfast as she laid out seemed a nicety too much. We have so many things to worry about, I silently scolded, and you bring white napkins?
Taking the trouble to set a pleasant table seemed to spill over with a generosity she didn't have to spare. You need it all, I wanted to say. Every drop and more. 
And yet, I believe such penny-pinching does not do, will not trade as currency in the country of grace. With my green eye shade pulled low, chewed pencil in hand, I try to battle illness like an accountant tallying columns. I am determined to find the missing figure that will set the balance sheet straight. Too much of this, I surmise, not enough of that. If only following a recipe would do the trick.  
Instead, Lori's illness, like so many inexplicable, ungovernable things in life, is like a whale ride. It's too big to know what part we're holding onto, impossible to steer. If anything will help, she has taught me, it must be imbued with grace, a respite from clenched teeth and whitened knuckles.
When large solutions are absent, small gestures are all that we have left. And so, in place of cod liver oil, as preparation for a sometimes heart breaking world, I offer my own prescription for breakfast:
2 chairs, facing out, into the wild. And, most importantly, strawberries. May sub. rasp. or blue.

004946.txt,Sang,,18 - 30,"Stanford, California","July 27, 2005",2005,This I Believe,creativity;family,"A few summers ago, my mother and I were trying to teach ourselves to swim. We were taking advantage of an uncle's new pool and some coaching from my girlfriend at the time, who was, I now think, some kind of mermaid. Our last attempt was in early September, just a couple of weeks before I left for grad school. Afterwards, we drove home in the minivan, both too physically drained to say much. But halfway back, my mother, who's neither prone to sentimentality nor storytelling, remembered something two decades past that she'd never shared with me before.
The memory was of the best swimmer she ever knew: a local legendary aqua-man and friend of the family's. Like my family and thousands of others, the Swimmer, with his non-aquatic wife and two sons, fled communist Vietnam as boat people, in the late Seventies. But while at sea, there was an accident. One that sent many, including his wife and sons, overboard. The Swimmer dove in to save them. But the water was thick with other fallen people–flailing, gasping, desperate not to die. So as he frantically tried to reach his loved ones, an underworld of limbs and hands and torsos grabbed hold of the Swimmer–dragging him beneath the surface. Everyone drowned.
September is the month when many of us rededicate ourselves to personal accomplishment and orderly living. For sure, that September of 2001, I thought I had my life pretty well staked out. I was about to start grad school. I was with the girl I intended to marry. I knew the feats I wanted to achieve. The plot seemed clear. But then, of course, it inevitably thickened.
Four years later, things are different than what I'd planned. In fact, one of the only ideas that remain from that time is the story my mother told: a Euripidean tragedy that casually spilled out, in the mundane setting of a minivan, during the ordinary occasion of driving home from the pool.
What I believe in are the accidental stories of life. The unexpected myths, romances, or cautionary tales we find ourselves swept up in. I believe in paying attention to those stories. I believe, on the one hand, in the undeniable power of history and chance to shape us all. I affirm, on the other, the human capacity for carving shared values and personal significance within that pandemonium.
We tell stories to ourselves, to make sense of the complicated topography of living. We tell stories about ourselves, to explain the messy trajectory of life. In our on-going narrations, we map the contours and compass of who we are. In the life-altering, heartbreaking, soul-making events that happen to us on epic journeys or everyday trips–in forging meaning from this whirlwind–we define our humanity. 
What I believe in is driving around in a minivan with your mother and listening to any stories she might have to tell.

Years ago I arrived at the university summer internship office with  a stack of jobs that I thought I could do and a matching stack of resumes, each tailored to a job.  The administrator was Mary, one of the few adult names from college that I remember.  She invited me to sit down and said something like this:  ""I bet that you could do these jobs.  What I want to know is what you are supposed to be doing.""  I looked blankly at her.  She sent me off with an assignment to write a job description for the summer internship of my dreams.  Confused and mad, I sat at my desk blindly writing about what interested me, most of which I knew nothing about.  My roommates teased me, but finally there it was, my piece of short fiction:  I would go to Washington, DC and photograph photojournalists as they the covered the White House and Congress.  I would earn enough to cover my living expenses.  Never mind that I was not a photojournalism major and had more marketable skills.   
A few weeks later, I stood in Mary's office shocked as she passed me a letter from the Smithsonian offering me an unpaid internship as a photojournalist working in the White House, Congress and elsewhere.  Plus a check for $4,000 from a wealthy alumnus.
A stranger, Mary, had given me what remains perhaps the greatest gift of my life.  She made me ask the question with which we answer with the events that become our lives.  And she invited me to ask her to help make it happen.  When I was unprepared to answer, she gave me a second chance.   
In the 20 years since, at every critical personal or professional juncture I have asked myself, ""What is it that I am meant to be doing?""  The question that helped me find my way as a college student has also generated the courage and stamina to pursue the answer.  I have worked in Asia, created a new product, earned graduate degrees, and made painful decisions to leave relationships only to find them reborn by the change. 
Today I am on the faculty of a medical school researching my passion:  how health affects career success and what medicine and business management techniques can do to help people reach their potential.  I play hooky often with my two-year old son and husband.  I marvel that I have three joys in every day.  And I find myself asking, ""When and how can I give the gift that Mary gave me?""

005581.txt,Benjamin,,50 - 65,"Alfred, New York","August 26, 2005",2005,This I Believe,work,"Expecting Nothing
     Thirty-four years ago, my father was looking forward to his retirement. A hand-some, reticent man, he was sixty-one years old. From his childhood on a farm in Ankeny, Iowa, through his long tenure as principal of Longfellow Elementary School in Clinton, Iowa, he had worked very hard. To make ends meet, he had moonlighted as a salesman at Sears and Montgomery Wards, and in the summers he had toiled as a manual laborer at Clinton Corn Processing Company, loading fifty-pound bags onto boxcars. He had every reason to anticipate a well-earned rest.
     Sadly, my father was never to enjoy his retirement. He contracted melanoma at the age of sixty-five and died a year later. In our last conversation, two months before his death, he spoke of the things he had hoped to do: reading, perhaps some writing. ""Maybe,"" said I, ""you were hoping for the wrong things."" ""I was hoping to enjoy life,"" he replied, ""and to spend time with my grandchildren. What's wrong with that?""
     Looking back on the past three decades, I believe that my father's mistake, if mistake it was, lay not in hoping for the wrong things but in expecting anything at all. In The Unexpected Universe, the paleontologist Loren Eiseley urges us to ask ourselves ""whether our own little planetary fragment of the cosmos has all along concealed a mocking refusal to comply totally with human conceptions of order and secure prediction."" ""The men of Shakespeare's century,"" he adds, ""may have known less of science, but they knew only too well what unexpected overthrow was implied in the frown of a monarch or a breath of the plague.""
       To be sure, the moon landing of July, 1969 was a triumph of advanced technology and scientific prediction. But who could have predicted that in the same month, Senator Edward Kennedy, a likely successor to the American presidency, would suffer a tragic and irreversible turn of fortune? I was married in that same month, but I could hardly have predicted that nine years later, my marriage would dissolve, depriving my four-year-old son and me of continuous contact. Nor could I have foretold that I am now happily remarried and that my grown son is enjoying a productive life in Boston.
     Please don't misunderstand me. To expect nothing is not to relinquish all hope or intention. ""Everyone comes out from nothingness moment after moment,"" writes the Zen master Shunryu Suzuki in Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind. ""So we say shin ku myo u : 'from true emptiness, the wondrous being appears.""' To expect nothing is not to indulge in nihilistic despair. Rather, it is to believe in a fertile nothingness, an infinite potential, which is ready to take on form and color.   
     This year I too am sixty-one, and come next May, I will retire from full-time college teaching. Endeavoring, as best I can, to expect nothing, I will also endeavor to be present, with gratitude and humility, for whatever may be coming out of nothing.

	I believe in the goodness of people. The first recollection I have of the goodness found in people began in First Baptist Church of Earlsboro, the summer of 2001 when I was 13. The message was about turning away from the old, whenever becoming a new follower of Jesus Christ. That must have been an odd topic because I looked around to see the new people stirring in their seats at our church that Sunday.  Bob Jones, the town drunk, was crying a few rows back which left me totally confused. I had heard that Bob lost his children because he beat on them, so why was he so emotional about a few words from God's message? The question burned in my mind and I asked my friend Michelle. ""I guess the message touches a part inside, that the people squirming in their seats have been fighting to ignore. Maybe it's because they don't want to admit that most of their lives have been wasted on self indulgence instead of pursuing what they know deep down is the right life to pursue."" This response kept me up for countless nights wondering, dwelling, and pondering exactly what Michelle could have meant. At last, I finally figured out what they had been struggling with. The people in church were feeling a call to live a life of goodness. That is simple enough, but what was difficult for me to grasp was, if a man who abuses his children can feel the conviction of goodness, then who couldn't? I guess anyone could. From that point on, I believed in the goodness in everyone, no matter gender or age, no matter who they were in social standing. They could be a prostitute, a drug dealer, or an abusive person, but I believe that everyone is capable of feeling goodness inside.

006062.txt,Samuel,,18 - 30,"Lake Forest, Illinois","September 12, 2005",2005,This I Believe,question;science,"I believe that all life is composed of atoms, tiny molecules that have been systematically controlling our universe since the beginning of time. A part of this belief is that the human being, like all creatures, is simply a structure of chemical processes we are only beginning to understand. The mind takes vast amounts of input from the world, including those of our senses and the chemicals in our brains, and sends output to the rest of our body every second in multiple ways. With such a highly sophisticated complex and artificial nature, it's no wonder people don't want to think of it as the essence of our personalities. I believe that with all the scientific knowledge we have today, including the basic structure of the human brain, the nonexistence of a soul is only logical. We are able to change the composition of the human brain with medication to induce the desired response, and yet humans put more faith in their religion as they do in their doctors. With scientific evidence building every day, it's becoming more and more obvious that there is no soul, but only an atomic break down to life. Why put so much faith into the idea of a soul when the only facts available are against it? Why put faith in the idea of a god for that matter?
	When I was little, I didn't understand a lot about religion and the difference between the idea of a god and Jesus. Driving with my family and some friends of ours to the zoo, the discussion turned to Jesus Christ. I was listening quietly when I suddenly piped up and asked, ""Yeah, but how do you know there was a Jesus?"" While the question was ignorant, it was the response that got me thinking; immediately everyone became offended and snapped back at me. It was at this point that I realized how people put too much emotion into their beliefs and not enough rationale.
	I believe that the existence of a god is no more likely than that of a soul. We live in a physical world, a place where the existence of a god doesn't sound very possible. That's why ever since science was born, religion has been changing, forced to mold into contemporary views that conform to common knowledge. If a major scientific discovery comes along, there is a new branch of religion to accompany it. I believe that by disproving many basic, foundational ideas of old religion but keeping others, society has, for centuries, lost sight of the truth and searched only for what it wants to hear. Instead, I believe that we should look to the hard, cold fats of science. It's ok to have no clue, to feel helplessly lost in a world without answers. In reality, that's what we are. Just be reasonable; go with what we know and work from there. Sure, there's always the possibility of a god. But what are the chances? You have more information at your fingertips than the people that wrote the bible. Were they filled with infinite wisdom, or just confused and lost like us?

One day I had had enough, I went home, grabbed my guitar and went straight to my room. I sat there for almost three hours, just playing. It gave me the most amazing feelings when I came out. Like a huge burden had been lifted off of me.
	Music is my peace spot. It's the place I go where you want to get away from everything and I won't be faced with problems, you just play. When I play, its like I go to a whole different place, more amazing then reality could ever be. I guess you can pretty much call it a fantasy.

There is no secret about ""finding a way"" to live in the real world.  Start with a small demand or irritation and ""find a way"" to change it.  Take the problem and nag it. Would this work, would that work, why wouldn't it work?  How can I do this? Me, not somebody else?
   Of course, it will take a bit of perseverance and resolve – just don't blame your past or your genes, instead make your past work for you.
   At age 66, eleven years ago, because of quadruple by-pass-surgery, I was told I had to exercise everyday.  At the time I was in an excellent cardiac rehab but my real life, as an embroidery teacher, wife and mother of 7, was deeply entrenched in my way of thinking.  I had to ""find a way"" to do this!  After all, I had done it before, attending 12 different schools, competing for limited embroidery teaching jobs and living with 5 teenagers, all at one time.  I did have some experience in change.
   First, I realized I hated exercise in any form.  But the bottom line was to somehow, get my heart rate up, today and 5 days a week.  A horrible idea.
   Walking seemed to be the only solution for me because I really like to be outdoors.  I forced myself to leave the house before 9am each day.  I would not let a conversation with my husband or the phone stop me.  I wear anything handy, warm clothes in the winter, light clothes and sunscreen in the summer.  Time for perseverance, responsibility and understanding, that in spite of what experts say, old habits are not broken in 90 days nor does your health noticeably improve in 90 days – in the real world.
   By ""finding a way"", I developed a ""bad weather"" program.  Set the timer for 20 minutes, warm-up with stretches, and then alternate running in place with lifting 5 pound weights, a bit of Tai chi, all in my nightgown and sneakers.  Mind you, this is done in the small space between the dresser and bed, but all that really matters is that my heart rate is up!
   When I first started, no one was out walking.  It was very lonely, but I truly did not want to be housebound for the rest of my life.  After all, I am the only living person in my family, all the others have died of heart disease.  I was making new choices.

Some of us let this gift remain wrapped  and stored in the basements of our hearts. Some choose to open the gift and use it to make the world a better place not only for the people they benefit, but also for many others whom they inspire.
One such person is an old lady who I saw for the first time seven years ago. I used to go to the market early in the morning to get milk, bread, eggs or any other things that were needed. I saw her there and in due course started taking note of her.
She bought some milk and couple of loaves of breads. These she fed to the strays that frequented the parking lot. Some dogs, a couple of cows, pigeons and birds were the beneficiaries of her compassion. Once satisfied everyone had eaten, she went back to her home.
Strays are a common problem in all the big cities of India. These animals, unwanted and unloved roam the roads at will, sometimes getting run over or sometimes causing accidents. There are shelters for such animals, but not enough space to accommodate all of them.
I would see the old lady feed these animals each morning and it brought a strange kind of joy in me. I was not the only one observing. Almost every regular would stop for a while and see her feed those animals.
One of the old lady's stray dogs hurt its leg. It was visibly in pain and the lady seemed unable to figure out what to do. The vet from the market saw this too. She came up to the old lady and offered help. Between them they took the dog to the clinic. The vet cleaned and bandaged the dog. This in turn inspired the shopkeepers. They would save a loaf of bread or some other treat for the dogs. They even named the dogs, and these strays found identities and acceptance. The stray animals had become a point of unity for the locality.
The children, who used to wait for their school bus near the parking lot, started bringing a cookie or a piece of bread from their homes and feed the old woman's dogs. Without realizing, the old lady had taught them a valuable lesson in compassion, a lesson though taught but never learned from books.
Through an act of love the old lady had managed to bind a diverse group. Not only had she been kind, she had opened the hearts of other people to the joys of doing good deeds. She may not be a Mahatma Gandhi or a Mother Teresa, but in her own small way she has attested to the fact that God has gifted each one of us with a capability to do infinite good and on the way inspire others to do good as well. A single good act is like water trickling through a leak in a dyke. The insignificant leak eventually breaks down the dyke and good covers everything.

Because of my modest upbringing I'd spent my life emulating that third pig.  Brick, by brick, I'd built a house that I thought was important and lasting.  A college education, a business degree, earthly possessions leading towards wealth, and a career in management.  One brick upon another, I thought I was building something of substance.  I was terribly wrong.  In one moment of insight I learned that each of these bricks was really a house of straw.  A house that held no substance, a house that would crumble the first time it was questioned.  Thankfully, my house crumbled.
There wasn't an earth-shaking event.  I wasn't diagnosed with cancer.  No loved one suddenly died. Nor did I experience an out of body experience.  The day I realized my life was meaningless was like any other day.   I pulled up at work, stepped out of the car, and went into my office.  For some reason when I sat at my desk and began my daily routine I stopped and thought about what I was doing. Although successful, I felt empty.  At this exact moment, I realized that every brick I'd laid down in my foundation was meaningless. I realized that it wasn't the possessions I owned, or the wealth I was accumulating, that would be the measure of my life. I knew in my heart that this kind of legacy would die with me.  I realized that my measure would be what I, and only I, would leave in the memory of others. In that one moment I knew my wealth was not in what I could accumulate, but in what I could give away. 
I left work that day, enrolled once again in college and 22 months later had a teaching credential.  Although I cut my salary in half, I am a much wealthier man.  However, my wealth is no longer measured by my possessions. Instead, my wealth is measured in each adolescent I help to discover his or her latent talents.  My success is no longer what I accumulate, but what I do each day to help a struggling youngster feel successful.  I am rich because wherever I go in my community I am welcomed and respected not for what I own–but for what I have given. This I believe is the true measure of wealth.  Not the possessions one owns, but the reputation one has gained through a willingness to give to others and help others to succeed.  I don't have a student who's become an astronaut, a senator, or an entertainer.  No student of mine is famous, or well known.  That doesn't matter, because over the last 18 years I've had thousands of students become vital productive members of my community.

I believe in Santa Clause. I believe that he is one of the greatest people in our history. Santa Clause is a large elf that lives in the North Pole. He also controls all the elves and can tell those little guys what to do. He lives forever and has magical powers. His magical powers are so cool they can unleash the power of happiness. His reindeer also have magical powers that are sweet because they can fly. If I had magical powers like Santa and reindeer I would fly to the moon.
There are some people who don't believe in Santa Clause. I feel sorry for them because not only do they get skipped over by the jolly fellow, but also they miss out on that little tingly holiday feeling that only Santa Clause can give to you. Santa Clause is the greatest because when ever he comes over for dinner he brings ice water from the North Pole. One year he didn't bring water but he brought lemonade instead. Christmas brings people together, families, friends, clowns and nuns, and even students and teachers.
Some people debate the fact that Santa is not real. But I have proof so those guys can hate if they want but I'm Santa's best friend and he will give me way more presents then non-believers. Santa's' reindeer also enjoy my carrots and Santa loves my milk and scrum dibiliumtious cookies. I always make them for him so I can get even more presents. He is the coolest person in the world and he always will be. That's why I believe in Santa Clause and you should too.

Most of the time, it is easier to say what you don't believe in than what you do. There are scientific explanations for things, religious explanations, and fantasy explanations. I don't believe in the religious explanations. The fantasy explanations can be crazy or weird, but I believe in some of them. the scientific explanations make the most sense. I mostly believe those.
	I believe in my parents and my relatives. I also believe in the Angles baseball team. I believe in my friends and my animals. Books and sports are some of the best things in the world to me. Magic intrigues me and home is the most comforting. Computers are my favorite electronics. 
	I believe in the Lockness monster and magic. I believe these things because I think anything can happen. I don't think anyone was expecting the crisis of 9/11. I also didn't expect to almost get ran over by a semi-truck. When my brother shot me in the head with an airsoft gun was also unexpected. 
	I believe these things because I get told things and I just think of random stuff. I think that books and outdoors are very important. There is nothing that is more important than life. Music (also known as rock) is important to me. I believe that there is more intelligent life out there in the millions of galaxies. I think that the other intelligent life is more ahead in technology than us, but they haven't gotten to us yet. I also believe that there are time machines in and the aliens that we think come from outer space are us in the future coming back to see where we went wrong.
	My mom thinks that crows are spies for the government. She doesn't really think that, that's just one of her crazy theories. She thinks of crazy stuff like that. I think that most of her made-up theories are crazy, but that's just me talking. Some people would probably think differently. 
	I believe that the mind is more powerful than anything else. I think that it can do amazing things. I think that that it is amazing that we only use like a tiny part of the brain and that Walt Disney explored most of the parts of the brain. Albert Einstein had the highest IQ, which was 158. He still didn't use as much as Walt Disney. This I believe.

007442.txt,Katie,,Under 18,Ohio,"October 24, 2005",2005,This I Believe,self-determination,"Dealing With What I Am Dealt
I believe that life is like a card game.  I will win some hands and I will lose some hands. I should always play the cards that I am dealt.  Everyday I am faced with new challenges, problems, and great opportunities.  Each day of life is a new hand of cards.  I get a fresh start and it doesn't matter what happened in the hand before because I can make up for it in the next hand.
I have often found myself thinking about a mistake I made the day before such as not studying for a test, wishing I could take back what I just said, or not trying my hardest at swim practice.  There's nothing I can do to fix the past.  I live in the present, but often think about the past.   
Last summer this belief was tested.  I didn't like the cards I was dealt and almost gave up.   I swim for Overhill Swim Club in the summer, and the year was not going how I wanted it to.  We have two relays and I wasn't on either!  In the past I had always made both the medley relay and the freestyle relay.  The hand was dealt and I didn't know if I could change it.  Towards the end of the season I was getting really frustrated and almost gave up all hope of making either relay. However, I continued to go to practice at the crack of dawn every morning and my hard work finally paid off.  At the last meet of the year I beat two of my teammates times and was on both relays for finals the following week.  At finals my freestyle relay broke the club record and my medley relay came within one second of the record.  
From this experience I learned that there was a reason why I was dealt those cards.  Maybe it was so I would learn that hard work and persistence do pay off and that I should never give up.  Maybe it was to show me that I could do anything I put my mind to.  Everyday I think about the cards that I am handed and what I can do with them.  I could try my hardest to do my best with them or I could throw them out.  With each problem that I am faced with I think about my cards.  I can't change what happened, but I can change my attitude and think positively about the situation.

I took my place in it seriously too.  I wanted everything to be perfect.  I wanted to be perfect. I remember many times shedding tears because I was so worried that something was not perfect.  My parents repeatedly told me to ""relax"".  They were certain that imperfection was not going to ruin my life.  
	I was nine and in the fourth grade when my I pitched a hysterical fit one night while doing my homework over what I believed was my ineptitude.   My mother said calmly, ""Just don't do the homework.  What's the worst thing that can happen?""   I firmly believed the world would end if I didn't complete that homework and it would end even more quickly and disastrously if I didn't do it perfectly.   My mother wisely knew that homework, whether complete or incomplete, whether perfect or not, didn't matter.  What mattered was the process, the growing,  and the learning.      
	I recently read an article by Anna Quindlin who, commenting on motherhood, shared her parental mistakes such as asking her daughter who had just gotten a 98 on a test, ""What did you get wrong?""  We are bound to make mistakes.  I have forgotten my children at school, scolded them for things they didn't do, and raised my voice unnecessarily.  No one is perfect.  
	Life has graciously given me (a mother of twins, a retired attorney, a wife, a volunteer, a former coach and a cancer survivor), the gift of perspective.  I frequently recall those conversations with my parents when they encouraged me to enjoy life, relax, and take things in stride.  The road to perfection is a long endless road.  It is better to enjoy my travels and learn from them than to save any celebration for an elusive destination called perfection.  I am still intense and I still take the world seriously.  And, I still strive for perfection.  What I know now that I didn't know when I was a child, is that the journey brings as much joy and pleasure as achieving the goal ever could.   This I believe will guide me always.  
	I strive to take chances, live creatively, and give freely and in doing those things, I certainly have made mistakes.  I celebrate those mistakes now.  Life has taught me to change, to learn, to grow.   It truly is the journey that matters.

I grew up in the Southern Appalachians where my father's family has lived for generations. They were masters of making do with little or nothing. From quilting to toy making, canning to music making, these people lived artfully and joyfully — and none more so than my father.  A stonemason by trade and musician at heart, my father filled us with a sense of abundance- even in the face of what most would consider to be a meager existence.   He filled our house with a love of music and had an eye for beauty.  He found great pleasure in small things — and was quick to share his wonder and gratitude. He marveled at the intelligence of honeybees and his children, at how many different shades of green you could find in one garden, the beauty of a freshly sliced beet.  He showed us how to whisper a doodlebug out of its dusty hole and how to talk to a news bee. From the porch alone, he could point out a dozen reasons to be thankful: hickory nuts, chinquapins, blackberries, black cherries, gooseberries, persimmons, poke salat, scuppernongs, muscadines, raspberries, elderberries, wild scallions — all gifts for the taking –all you had to do was notice and enjoy.   He taught me to appreciate tinkering, puttering or just sitting quietly to watch trees dance in the wind.  He taught me that, if you see the best in people, people will show you the best in themselves.  And that to be without money does not mean to be poor of spirit. These many years later, even from my home in the suburbs, I am continually reminded to notice the abundance that surrounds all of us.  And I am delighted to find that the reminder comes most often from those we usually assume have nothing at all.  In my poem The Gleaner, I salute those who, like my father, value the beauty of trees dancing in the wind.  
The Gleaner
Brought forth from a long line of stalwarts
steeped in the pride of knowing how to make do
(with naught or less than)
possessing a steeled jaw, nose well suited -and used to —
holding firm and long to the proverbial grindstone
brow and long-angled back pitched ever forward in hearty plow fashion
he scratches through the supposed detritus of his neighbor's lives
a perpetual infusion of wondrous and revealing artifacts
discarded in a steady stream and strewn
along the suburban curb
From amongst the reeking remains of 
vacuum-packed family occasions, he gleans.
conjuring baubles, novels, cord, glass blocks,
lamps, just today, a ladder
 (made sturdy with the help of a crossbar found in a neighboring can)
three yards of snowflake cotton print folded
together with a hand embroidered tablecloth and six napkins
a can of hominy — still under warranty
and —- ""Ah, yes."" – the footstool he's been awaiting.
""All things come–"" 
burrow-packed back
bent and straining over quick feet
eyes darting, he hums along home

In December of 1977, I returned from my Mormon mission in Indonesia.  I was full of enthusiasm for God and my religion.  One day some Jehovah's Witness came knocking at our door looking to spread their message.  I was delighted to see them and invited them in.  We talked of God and discussed some of their doctrines.  I shared many of the same passions they felt: the desire to reach a unity of faith with others and to serve God. 
My father in passing noticed them and my friendly rapport with them. He was more than a little startled to see them in his home. I had grown up occasionally hearing jokes and views quite critical of the Jehovah's Witness, or JWs as most LDS called them. When approached, most of us ignore them or let them know we thought their beliefs were ridiculous. So seeing me on such friendly terms with two of them concerned him. 
After we agreed to meet up again and they left, he questioned me:  Was I looking for another religion? Was I hoping to convince them against their beliefs? What was wrong with me? Didn't I believe in Mormonism? Why had I invited these Jehovah's Witness into his home? 
He caught me off guard. At first I simply said, ""I felt like it, I just wanted to talk to them.""  I didn't really have a good reason.  I hadn't thought it through. But later I went back to him and asked him, 
""Didn't Christ tell us to love one another? How can I love others if I don't get a chance to know them? They came to me in the name of Christ; how could I turn them away? Don't we pray that non-members will listen to our missionaries?  Isn't it then hypocritical to reject the missionaries of other faiths?""  Except for a little grumbling, he left me alone after that.
I visited them and attended a few of their meetings. Their passion and devotion touched me deeply. When I really listened to them I realized that their beliefs and devotion to their faith gave them as fulfilling life as any Mormon. I went on to visit and enjoy many other religions including Moslems, Bahai, Buddhist, Catholics and several Christian sects.  Likewise they, too, have given their lives an incredibly beautiful meaning. 
I have explored new-age ideas and been astounded at the beauty of the thoughts I have been given to consider. I witnessed many touching testimonies of how God had led someone to a better life, through obedience to their respective faiths, then blessed their lives. So what if they believe (as I once did) that everyone should join their religion. That's okay.  But what a loss that would entail!  I prefer the variety.
I don't just tolerate, I embrace and explore the mountains and lakes of our diverse cultures.  I don't want to end discrimination. I want to begin appreciation.

007988.txt,Jennifer,,Under 18,"Orangevale, California","April 15, 2010",2010,The Seven Wonders of the World,education & knowledge,"I once heard a story of an elementary school class who was learning about the Seven Wonders of the World.  The teacher asked the children in the class to list what they thought were the seven wonders.  After each child wrote a short list, they reviewed their lists to see what they had in common.  Some of the children had written the Great Wall of China, and many had written the Egyptian pyramids.  But there was one little girl who sat in the front of the classroom who said nothing.  The teacher asked her if she had either of these sites on her list.  The girl shook her head no.  The teacher then asked the girl what she had listed.  The girl stood up and read, ""The Seven Wonders of the World: 1st – sight; 2nd – touch; 3rd – sound; 4th – smell; 5th – life; 6th – laughter; and 7th – love"".
Nowadays, many things in life are taken for granted.  I believe that this world is an amazing place to live, and that we should be grateful for all the wonderful things that we have.  As Americans, we are some of the most blessed people on Earth.  We have houses to live in, good food to eat, and limitless opportunity for education.  Family and friends surround us.  We have every reason in the world to be happy.  
Nevertheless, there are many people who are unhappy, and seem to be blind to the magnificent world around us.  These people just don't realize what a wonderful world we live in.  My wise grandpa once told me, ""Life is a gift, that's why it is called the present"".  I truly believe that life is a gift, that the world is a wonderful place to live, full of laughter, and love, and happiness.  Life is meant to be enjoyed.  So the next time you're feeling down, look around, and remember the real Seven Wonders of the World.

008024.txt,Shelley,,30 - 50,"Los Lunas, New Mexico","November 15, 2005",2005,This I Believe,children;social justice,"The Hungry Child
This I believe–as Americans, we have a moral obligation to ensure that our children never know what it is like to be a hungry child.  I was a hungry child.   Many nights I laid in the cramped bed I shared with my two brothers, listening to the sound of our stomachs calling out to the empty night with deep growls of desperation.  We would sneak to the kitchen and drink large quantities of water hoping to at least stop the sounds long enough to allow us to get to sleep.   It wasn't the morning sunshine that would wake us from our slumber, but rather the pain of our bodies demanding to be fed.  There was nothing in the house to be consumed–but we had a beacon guiding us to safety in the form of a pale blue free lunch ticket offered by our elementary school.
So many children who receive free lunch are ashamed.  I was not ashamed. I needed that meal.  I looked forward to that meal.  I knew that it could possibly be the only one I would get that day.   When the school expanded the program to include a free hot breakfast, I was certain that it was God's divine intervention.  Certainly he had heard the prayers of his hungry children.  Now, we were guaranteed at least two meals every day of the week.  We only had to worry about the weekends now.
A few years ago, I was watching the U.S. Senate on television in heated deliberations over ways to cut the federal budget.  A rather rotund, elderly, white, gentleman in resplendent attire took the floor. I do not recall his name.  He pompously proposed eliminating free lunch programs in public schools as a national cost saving measure. He gave figures of the millions of dollars that could be saved by eliminating this ""needless"" act that should be handled within individual families rather than the school system.    I knew this man had never been a hungry child. I knew that he did not represent me.   When he yielded the floor, a petite African-American woman dressed in a simple suit stood up and addressed the Senate.  She said, ""I was a hungry child.   Many times, the only meal I got in a day was the meal given to me in my school's free lunch program.  I will not support balancing the federal budget deficits by taking that critical element away from America's children.""  
The Senator said nothing more, but just abruptly took her seat.  Just before the camera moved away from her, I saw a single tear run down her cheek.  I was mesmerized by her brief, yet eloquent speech.  A moment later I felt wetness on my folded hands in my lap and realized that tears were streaming down my cheeks and falling into my hands.  This woman, whose name I do not even know, changed my life.  She helped me realize that those of us who knew what it was like to be a hungry child, must not be silent.  This I believe–We must ensure that our children never know the pain and the shame of being hungry.

008094.txt,Daniel,,18 - 30,"Oak Ridge, Tennessee","November 16, 2005",2005,This I Believe,question,"The thought of eternal damnation perplexed me as a child. Although I am the son of a liberal Methodist minister the idea of Hell was still very present in Sunday school classes and youth groups. I simply could not grasp the concept that a God who loved you would sentence you to be punished for all eternity, merely for the fact that you did not believe in his son. This presented an angry Zeus-like image of God, very different than the one I was told loved me unconditionally. Being too embarrassed to ask a knowledgeable adult, I would ask other churchgoers my age about the issue. A typical answer would be: ""That's the way it is."" This statement raised a second question of ""who makes the rules?"" The answer is obviously God, bringing us back to the original question. I tried to not worry about it and do my best to be a good Christian. After all, I didn't want to end up in Hell. However, that didn't work for me. I couldn't force myself to believe. I thought, ""Why can't living an honest, loving life be good enough?"" I pondered this question until I decided that Hell was a paradox and couldn't possibly exist. After I discontinued my belief in Hell my thoughts on religion became all the more liberal. I began to think of Jesus as a teacher, rather than the messiah. I discovered that the importance of his teachings outweighed the manner of his death, and that living an honest, loving life is good enough. 
Taking judgment out of the equation I was left with more of a Santa Clause image of God. This didn't fit right either. The notion that when you die you ascend into the sky with a bearded, behemothic being, play the harp and eat low-fat cream cheese on a cloud, seemed too simple to me. To me, God, and the afterlife had to be more than that. I realized that the Bible should be interpreted in most cases and not taken literally, but there was one phrase that stuck out in my mind. I had heard the phrase numerous times in church but had never really thought about it. ""God is love."" I took this one literally and began to think of God not as an all-powerful being in the cosmos but as the undeniable force of love in the universe. It's what binds the universe together in harmony, and drives us to love one another, as Christ taught. With this in mind, the idea of Hell recurred to me. Not as a place, but simply as the absence of love, whether on earth or in the afterlife. 
I see some truth in every religion and there is always something to be learned. I still have no idea what happens after this life, but I'm interested to find out. My spiritual journey is by no means complete. My beliefs could change completely throughout my life, but for now this works for me.

Have you ever heard the saying ""fathers knows best?"" Well, so do mothers.  They know when their helpless child is about to be in danger. They can tell when their children are lying or telling the truth.  For some reason there seems to be a strange connection between a mother and a child that goes beyond the realm of human understanding.  My mom is no exception to that rule.
One day when all my friends were going to the Michigan Dunes, I had to stay home.  My mom said I didn't look so good and I needed to rest for a day or so.  I was so mad that I couldn't go; I even suggested some alternatives like, ""I'll go home with the first person that would leave,"" and ""I won't go out tomorrow.""  She didn't buy it though and I had to stay home.
I was so bored, being the ONLY one home and all, so I decided to take a nap. I woke up a couple hours later sweating with a fever.  I got up to find myself dizzy and unable to even walk, yet managed to tremble my way to my mom's room.  As soon as I reached her room, she asked me what was wrong and all I remember was falling to the ground.  I was just so weak; I couldn't hold myself up.  My mom had me lay down and she made an emergency doctors appointment for me.  I got there to find out I had mononucleosis and was anemic.  After that, I had to stay in bed for over a week and was very ill.
What if I had gone to the Dunes and fallen to the ground?  My friends wouldn't have known what to do; and they would have probably freaked out, not to mention the car ride home would have been terrible.  What if they were to call an ambulance?  My mom would have had to come to a Michigan hospital, which would have been completely unnecessary.
I really think moms have a sixth sense.  It was a really good thing I didn't go to the Dunes and my mom knew it.  I was terribly sick and my mom made me stay back for a reason, she just knew.  If your mother doesn't think you should go somewhere, odds are something bad will happen, so you shouldn't go!  If everyone listened to their mother's advice, they would be a lot safer and maybe even live longer! If I get mad when I'm about to miss out on something, I just realize it was probably for the best and learn to let life take its course.

Angry saguaros seemed to reach to the sun to avenge the pain and loneliness it's given them. The raggedy scrubs demonstrate the pathetic attempt of decoration. Descending to the crusty sand, my outlook suddenly changes! Now the saguaros look so green with content. Now they rejoice in open arms, embracing the sun's warmth. The sand that looked so barren and dry, sparkles and stretches out as far as the eye can see. The sparkly stretch reminds me of mother earth smiling to ensure the universe knows of her happiness. Her intent is only to spread the glory and happiness as smiles usually do. As I ponder the beauty of it all, a jackrabbit hops along the desert floor. The ballad of the cricket creeps from under a rock, serenading me as I grow weary. I lay on a warm, flat rock with the sharp rattle of the desert in the background. Suddenly a sour sensation urged me to arise. Upon arisal, I felt a sharper sensation in my back. But what is this? I'm too late. By that time the potent venom had reached my mind. I turned around to find the source. Staring directly in the eyes of a six foot diamondback, I froze, when it struck the final blow to my face. Before the fangs met the face I fainted. As you should know, I never woke up, and my body is still awaiting its dinner meeting with the hungry vultures.
	How does this relate to life? Well think of it this way. The desert was my life. Before I took a closer look, it seemed bland, vast and even depressing. However once I took a closer look, I was overwhelmed with the beauty and magnificence of it all. Being overwhelmed with beauty, I didn't care to notice the ugly parts. The cactus needles, scorpions, spiders, and lets not forget the snakes. I was to fresh to get safely comfortable. If I did pay attention to both sides of the spectrum than I would have been able to enjoy the beauty while avoiding, but still enjoying, the dangers. This would have allowed me to live a longer, happier life. So I believe that amongst the beauty, we also must be aware of the ugly, vise versa.

Into that aggregate also flows the universal will to survive, which is observable in every little blade of grass, every dot-sized fruit fly, every life form including planets and seaweed and earthworms and ants and people and all – all of those ""Will-Survive""s add up to a great loud, deep, massive chorus of ""WILL SURVIVE.""

The belief in god for some makes them go to church or a mosque or a temple. The belief in God in others makes them go and spend their time in proselytization. So the beliefs that people have is the determining criterion for the actions that they take- actions that fall into two categories right or wrong.  
I, thus have only one belief. I believe that there is an absolute dividing line between right and wrong. Every action I take then has to be viewed in that light of right and wrong. So for me the only beliefs that I have are those that make me take the 'right' action.
This single belief however forces me to define right and wrong, and this then causes a dilemma. How do I define right and wrong, for the definition of that itself is depends on my beliefs.
If I followed a book, and if that book says 'love thy enemies' then I have to act accordingly. So the action that it makes me do is to find my enemies and try to convert them to follow my book.  But our enemies may also have a book. Their belief in that book could be as much as yours. If their book says 'kill all your enemies' then the situation is ripe for wars, misery, death.

'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness'.
Ever since I first read those words from behind a bullet proof glass, on a visit to this country, those words have become the truth that I use to assess actions, mine and others around me. For, they let me determine if any action that I am taking is right or wrong.  This truth is my cornerstone of beliefs and from this single belief arises all other beliefs.
So I let my sons not believe in god, let my wife pray to statues, my friends go to churches and never pick a fight with them for that is their pursuit of happiness.  And when I get the right to vote I will vote for that party that acts and supports all who have lost the ability to achieve their right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness, no matter why, because that is the right action.

009678.txt,Fred,,30 - 50,"Due West, South Carolina","December 27, 2005",2005,This I Believe,Christianity;golden rule,"I believe that the Christian scriptures help us meet a Friend who loves us and never leaves us.
When I was thirteen years old my father died. The world of baseball and football and fishing — the world that we had enjoyed together and that I naively thought would go on and on — that world disappeared. Like Job says, ""Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.""
That same year, my great-grandfather died. I saw a great contrast in their funerals. My father had been a restless man — it wasn't easy for him to reach out to others in friendship. But at the church where my great-grandfather was buried, I could see that he was loved by many. Something his   preacher said about the book of First John stuck in my imagination. ""In this little letter, written in the first century, the word 'know' is used more than thirty times."" I thought, to know something with that kind of confidence in this world of uncertainty — that is something worth investigating. 
So that is how my search began. Here is what I began to discover — not just in that year, but in the long years since: in I John, ""knowledge"" is united with love — not just the feeling of love — though that feeling can be important, but the actions of love. The actions of love have a specific shape according to John. If I want to know what love is, I should look at the way Jesus lived.
When Jesus saw hungry people, he made sure that they got enough food to eat. When Jesus passed Blind Bartimaeus on the road, he stopped long enough to restore his sight. When distraught parents came and asked him to heal their children, he did not refuse their requests. 
But I have had trouble understanding how such a human being, full of kindness, justice, and love for others, could be regarded as a threat to the institutions of government and religion. They must have believed that their economic and social interests were threatened by Jesus' way of life. That must be why they sent soldiers to arrest him. When his disciples saw the soldiers approaching, they started to draw their swords, but Jesus told them not to fight. When Jesus came before Pilate, again he said, ""My followers do not fight."" It was easy for Pilate to crucify such a 'harmless' person, but he never could have anticipated that Jesus' Father would raise him from the dead on the third day. 
Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the World War II martyr, said, ""In the life of Jesus the world is radically affirmed, in the death of Jesus the world is radically judged, and in the resurrection of Jesus, the world is radically transformed.""
In Jesus' day, disciples were often called ""servants,"" but he called his followers ""friends."" I believe that this path of  friendship with Jesus, no matter how costly, is the best kind of life there can be.

The rewards of teaching aren't as immediate as some other professions.  It's not like a doctor who can diagnose and prescribe medicine right away.  It's not like a lawyer who can hear the verdict being read, or an electrician who can turn the lights on to see the success of their labor. Teachers can grade tests or homework assignment to see if their students are learning information, but they can't measure how they've touched their students' souls. Sometimes they don't find out until years later, sometimes they don't find out at all. But their students know.
When I was in the sixth grade at Truman Elementary in Kansas City, Missouri in 1972, I had such teachers who touched my soul.  Ms. Sarah Black was young, and pretty with long blonde hair. I thought I was so cool because I knew her first name.  The same kind of cool I thought it was to bring my 45 record of ""Snowbird"" by Anne Murrray to play at lunch every day.  Ms. Black used the independent study model. She gave us math packets. Once we finished a packet we started another. It was revolutionary. I wrote Ms. Black a note and told her when I grew up I wanted to be a teacher because I loved her so much. She gave me a hug and told me I had to come back and tell her when I did even if she was a hundred years old. She must be in her late-fifties by now. I'm hoping Ms. Sarah Black or someone she knows listens to NPR radio and This I Believe so I can tell her I'm in my 24th year of teaching, and she touched my soul. 
During that same year Mrs. Herbert taught me English. One of my favorite subjects although Mrs. Herbert wasn't one of my favorite teachers. She was old, and even from my twelve-year-old perspective I knew she was getting ready for retirement. As part of her class, Mrs. Herbert held a story contest.  I wrote a story called Where's My Partner, about a go-go boot named Valoree who got stolen from the shoe store. I won first place and free books at the book fair. But more importantly Mrs. Herbert wrote this on my story:  ""Debbie, I enjoyed your story too.  I hope this is the beginning of a writing career.  Mrs. Herbert.""
	I still have that story.  I've held onto it all these years, just as I held onto the idea that maybe, someday I could be a writer. I'm not sure how old Mrs. Herbert is by now. I've tried to find her, but I haven't had any luck.  I want to tell her my fifth children's book is being published this year. I want to give her copies of them all and say ""thank you.""  I want her to know she touched my soul.

I believe that to be a father you have to be a man. My definition of a man is that he is someone who can handle their issues and what they need to do to support the female after they get a female pregnant and I'm not saying that he has to stay in a relationship with her but at least help her out with that baby and be there when she and the baby needs him. In a man you will find a real stand up guy, you won't find a child or a immature teenager; you will find a MAN, a man you will never have to worry about them never showing up for anything. They will always know when to show up and whenever the child needs something they will never think twice about providing for the child.
I believe that I have always had a real man as a father. He might yell and fuss, But I know that he wouldn't do me wrong and won't let anyone else do me wrong either, I've realized that even though he isn't my biological father he treats me as if he is. He has always been there and I wouldn't have to ask for anything. I believe that Father's Day should be his day where he would relax and everything would be catered to him, but he wouldn't let that happen, he wants to cater to my mom, my brothers, and me. Ray Anthony West is the complete and best definition of a father and a real man.
My biological father, or best known as my sperm donor. I really don't want to be mean but that's all he is to me. He has always asked for my address and e-mail address and my phone number, but he has failed to call, visit or contact me through e-mail. He never cared or tried to make a difference in my life. I guess I was only another child on the street that he would just walk by and never pay any attention to. I never got a present or was even remembered on July 8th, Christmas, or a present just to say that he cared that I was alive. The worst thing about it is that I always remembered him around Father's Day, but I never bothered because I was not ever acknowledged as being his daughter or someone he knows and it would hurt a lot but have realized that I do not need to rely on anyone but the people I know that cares about me. It is hard not to hate him as much as I feel like hating him, and sometimes I wish he was not my father, but I guess he is not because he gave up his rights when I was five. 
Father is a strong word that I can use with certain people and they know who they are. They are people that stand up for what they need to do and they never slack on their job. This is my This I Believe Essay and no one told me what to write or how to write it came straight from true life experiences. 
I dedicate this Essay to My father Ray Anthony West, my FATHER.

009917.txt,Susan,,50 - 65,"Torrington, Connecticut","January 9, 2006",2006,A Birthday Month,birth;carpe diem,"A Birthday Month: Why this is a good idea
From the first day of my birth month, I have a good time every day until the month is over.  During each of the 29 or so days, something special happens. 
On many of the days, thoughtfulness is extended to me from friends or family members. This may include phone calls, meals at simple and fancy restaurants, cut flowers, birthday cards, presents, a cup of coffee or unexpected visits. One year,  a favorite high school friend arrived at my office with a bakery-decorated birthday cake.  What a surprise!  On the other days during the month, I do something nice for myself.  This can range from walking in the woods, to indulging a breakfast ba-gel with cream cheese, to splurging on a new set of earrings.  
For many years my birthday seemed to stretch out around the actual day; and a pattern emerged. The actual birth day began to diminish in importance and the month, emerged as significant.  Now, I am a believer in the concept.  These are the reasons why every person should consider this alternative was to celebrate.
First, a Birthday Month is less stressful for your friends and family members all of who lead busy lives  – taking care of homes, working to pay the mortgage, raising children, caring for aging parents, aging themselves and on and on. It is difficult to remember what we have to do the next day, never mind remembering the exact day that others were born.  It is much easier to remember a birthday month.  
And sending the (belated) birthday card exacerbates the guilt of forgetting. If friends and family forget, they feel badly, you feel hurt and the whole thing esca-lates into something that could be avoided if you gave them a whole month to re-member you! Just think of how easy it is to remember when Memorial Day (end of May) or Labor Day (beginning of September) is.
Second, a Birthday Month also gives Mother Nature a lot of chances to cooperate.  On the day of your birth, if it rains at your picnic, if the snow and sleet leave roads impassable, if the heat and humidity is insufferable, so what?  There are at least 29 other days to party.  
Similarly, your health is given a chance to cooperate too.  Having a bout with the flu on your birth day takes away the one special day that you have waited for all year long.  That is not fair.   If you catch a cold, contract a case of poison ivy, or suffer from PMS, the conditions may raise their ugly heads on your birth day but they will not last for an entire month. This way you can (make up) for the days you were sick.
Fourth, Birthday Months are good for the economy.  Think about what greeting card manufacturers could do! . The recipient, too, stands to gain. I check the mail-box every day during the month, and  with anticipation.  Not every day, but often enough, cards arrive.  It seems that friends and family send more cards because the embarrassment of being late is taken away.   Retailers would be ecstatic with promise of a buying frenzy. Advertisers would have a field day.    Restaurants would experience an increased number of  breakfasts, lunches and dinners.  This would ring those cash registers.  During my Birthday Month last year I went out for cof-fees (decaf, thankfully)  three times in one morning with different friends.  
Fifth, there is no disappointment for you.  When someone forgets your birthday, you might agonize over the reasons why – depending on the depth of your relation-ship.  When you have a whole month, there is the likelihood that you will forget who remembered and who forgot by the month's end.  There are too many days where the possibility or potential exists.  Hope rules. And combine the nice things that do occur, with those you do for yourself, and the missing pieces become obscure.  Less grudges, less stewing and more good will.
Sixth, celebrating a Birthday Month is just plain fun. It forces you do things for yourself – something many of us find tough to do. This is not self indulgent and there is no need to be extravagant.  It is about the goodness of life, the day to day treats that you finally pause to enjoy during your month.  Concentrate on simple blessings such as riding a swing in the park, getting a Cappuccino instead of just coffee, making a phone call to a friend you haven't seen for years, a dinner out at that funky restaurant you pass in your commute to work. Take control. Out of the 29 or so days of your Birth Month those that you fill may be the most memorable of all.
For these reasons, the Birthday Month is an idea that is worth considering.  Think of the holiday season in December. If you could minus the work and obligations, and just became a recipient of the best that the season offers, December would be a wonderful month.  This is the magic that a Birthday Month offers. And it is yours for the taking.  All you have to do is declare it!  And Happy Birthday Month to you.

We often think about our purpose in life, what motivates us, what keeps us on the straight and narrow, that is, moral and ethical.
I believe we all want as much happiness as possible, and we need a degree of wellbeing for ourselves and our children provided by food, shelter, clothing, safety. 
I believe self-preservation is a strong motivator. I am careful about traffic on foot, bicycle, or in a car,  and am careful when I am on skis, on mountain hikes, etc.  I am concerned about my health and try to take good care of myself.    I try to stay in good condition, and avoid activities that could damage my health such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, over eating, etc. 
One cannot say I want to be happy and then be happy. It is a state of mind we cannot wish for ourselves. I believe we can find happiness by the way we live our life.  For me happiness seems to come with family relationships and with my contacts with other people, male or female.  I enjoy the company and conversation with others. I also enjoy what others have written and read as much as possible. I learn most of what I know that adds to my happiness from my parents, family, friends, books, and life experiences.  I learn from TV and movies if I chose the right programs.
I believe it is rewarding with many happy hours working with others for the good of the community. There is a reward for doing good things for others. There is no end to opportunities to be of service.   When we give of ourselves, we receive back a sense of satisfaction, a sense of being worthwhile, a sense of purpose, often gratitude and recognition as well, but that is not a good reason for being of service. 
Knowing that I want to be happy and have shelter, food, security, etc., I believe that is what others want.   I try to treat other people as I would want them to treat me, and that is treatment that makes me happy.  What makes me happy is a nice smile on other people faces. I believe the easiest  way to accomplish that is a greeting  to others with  a smile. You almost always get a smile back no matter how deep in thought, worry, or concern is the other person.  We are all much more attractive when we smile, be they big grins or sly little smiles. Love makes us happy, and I believe the best way to get love is to love others.  I believe when we show our concern and compassion for others in their time of need, they in turn will support you and show concern for you.
I like to compliment people on their accomplishments, often on their appearance, even their behavior. It is tricky, as you don't want to appear to be flattering, and seeking such compliments for yourself.
I don't go to church so have my charitable money free to use as I wish. I very much enjoy giving what I can afford to a wide number of charities and organizations. It makes me happy when I write the checks knowing I am helping others.
I try to live in harmony with what I consider my moral imperatives. When I was young it was very important I not do anything that would reflect badly on our family. I still feel that way and so do my children and my wife.  I believe your sense of honesty and your reliability is very important in work and life. I try to be honest as possible and be reliable in keeping commitments.  My marriage vows are a very strong commitment, and while, like Jimmy Carter,  I may have lusted in mind and heart, I know if I crossed the line, it would be the end of my marriage, family unity, and happiness.
I know the question of life after death is an open consideration for many, and many believe in some form of life after death.  I believe there is nothing about me that is immortal, except what others will remember about my activities or me. I believe this is the one life I have, I want to live it the best I can.

010154.txt,Jason,,Under 18,"Poughkeepsie, New York","January 17, 2006",2006,This I Believe,education & knowledge,"I believe that all people deserve and should get a good education.  If your parents or grandparents did not get a good education, that does not stop you from getting one.  An education helps you to get a good job with a decent salary.  It helps you to solve basic problems that you couldn't solve if you weren't educated, and it also helps with just living a productive life.  We use what we learned in school everyday and if you never had a good education, then you could be missing out on so many opportunities.  Without a decent education, you probably wouldn't have as a fulfilling life as a person that did have an education.  
Everyone deserves an education because it is now almost a requirement of a person to have a good education in order to go far in their life.  Nothing is stopping you from getting a good education even if none of your past relatives have.  With all the people who will do a job for a lot less pay, you need an education.  An education can bring you very far in life.
An education can open up many new opportunities for a person as well.  If you lived in poverty, you could use your education to help get yourself out of poverty.  You might also get an opportunity to go to college.  You could also even discover a new species of animals, or invent something that could be very useful in the world, or discover cures for diseases such as cancer.
I believe that it is not wise to shirk your studies just so you can get it over with.  No matter how hard it seems to be, you should push yourself to do as best as you can.  Allowing yourself to get a college degree is one thing everyone should aim for.  Trying to do the best job possible in everything you do is also very important.  An education is key for your success in life.
All in all, I believe that a good education is a necessity for living a productive life.  The lack of one is very bad in my opinion because everyone needs an education.  Everyone deserves a chance at trying to live the best possible life they can and it starts with an education.

010161.txt,FC,,50 - 65,"San Francisco, California","January 17, 2006",2006,This I Believe,equality;family;tolerance,"I believe it's a fundamental human right to love others without fear.  I believe this right extends to loving people despite their race, national origin or gender, their intelligence quotient, physical abilities or disabilities, disease or health, career or disenfranchisement.  I believe that blind judgment and blatant rejection of others who choose to love someone different from themselves is mean-ness in its purest form.  
	I have been soundly rejected for a large part of my life by a large part of my white Italian-American upper middle-class family because I love someone whose skin does not match theirs.  In all ways, this man of mine is the finest of beings.  And not for the World would I forsake him for those who have never even laid eyes on him nor seen us together, never had a two minute conversation with him, but who hold him in contempt and would have me turn my back on him because of their fear of this person who looks different.
	It brings me great pain when I receive letters back from relatives marked (RTS)– Return to Sender.  Some of the very people who loved and nurtured me as a child, are unwilling, despite all the many successes in my life, to give even the smallest consideration that perhaps, 22 years ago, I made a good choice after all. What sin have I committed to be treated as this pariah?  How has my husband hurt anyone by loving and being loved by me?  
	For me to attend large family gatherings is for me to be the Scarlett O'Hara wearing the red satin dress in the midst of all who have rejected her as a whore.  
Those dear ones who have opened their hearts and share the rewards of knowing my husband for the gentle, loving person that he is, are considered traitors by the others with their self-righteous narrow-minded cause.  I have broken no law, except the one unspoken which loudly declares, (Marry your own kind.)  To which I respond, (I have married far above my own kind, and I will never for one moment regret it.)  
     Everyone loses in this game.  My husband and I lose the belonging and love of family members I once believed in, they lose sharing in my happiness at having found my life partner, and the greater family loses its wholeness which is now fractured, separated by those who accept and those who do not, those who embrace and those who fear, those who love and those who hate, those enlightened and those in darkness.  
     What I have is blessed and cannot be diminished.  Forgiveness is easy for me.  Can those others say the same?

010289.txt,Janis,,50 - 65,"Cedar, Michigan","January 23, 2006",2006,This I Believe,empathy & compassion;golden rule;goodness & kindness,"I have been an R.N. and nurse practitioner for over 3 decades. I have cared for many people in varying states of health. When I was a young nurse practitioner, I believed that, if I nursed each person as I would want someone else to nurse my own grand-parents, parents, siblings, spouse or child, then surely some kind hearted care giver would intuitively extend the same compassion to my family if I were unable to be there with them. 
I believe, we are all connected and are not separate from one another even if distant, or our language, race, political and spiritual beliefs are different. I feel this connection to be something akin to dropping a pebble in the water, then standing back and watching the widening ripples broaden further and further out. The pebble is my act of concern, gentleness and respect for the person in my presence at any given time. I believe the ripples will reach through them and beyond, ultimately returning to touch those I love. I believe I choose each and every second whether to send ripples of love or hate, peace or violence, fear or trust. 
Reflecting on those I have cared for both professionally and personally, some have been easier than others. A small innocent child, a fragile elder, a teen-ager in love with life and its unlimited possibilities have all been easy to relate to and care for. It has been the hostile, abusive, negative people who have challenged my ability to send ripples of love and concern in their direction. Now as an (old) experienced nurse practitioner, I am convinced those qualities make me uncomfortable because they remind me of my own humanness. They cause me to take stock of my own actions and beliefs which may not always be as they appear on the surface. These days, I welcome the opportunity to step out of my comfort zone. It is by stepping out that I have gained a truer appreciation for all human beings, including myself.
I believe I still attempt to interact with patients as I would want my loved ones or myself cared for. What has changed is how I do that. I no longer think I know what is best for anyone and believe it is by simply listening and supporting a person in their life process that I can make a difference. I believe we all need to be heard while we tell our personal story. This is far more important than having someone talk at us. I believe in the power of listening and, when appropriate, touching people. I believe we humans are all made of the same water, and that we constantly decide what type of ripple effect we wish to be. I have lived long enough now to see my loved ones (including a grand-child) in the care of other health care professional and I am pleased to report, most of the ripples that have touched them are as I have wished.

My career as a special education teacher began twenty-seven years ago.  I have witnessed the full spectrum from heroic achievements to shattered dreams.  Listen and closely observe the enabled (not disabled) and you will discover great wisdom.  Listen to those who are least listened to and you will discover profound truth.  
(What is the meaning of life?) I asked one of my autistic students. Without any hesitation he replied, (The meaning of life is to live a meaningful life.)  Live a meaningful life and do small but meaningful tasks.  The goals you establish are in fact the meaning of your life.  
My students have taught me that there are four essential characteristics needed to be successful in life and they are attitude, effort, perseverance and getting along with others.  Let me briefly explain.
Nothing can stop a man or a woman with the right mental attitude and nothing can help a man or a woman with a bad attitude.  My students call this a gooditude.   A good attitude is more important than your I.Q., your appearance, or how much money your family has.  A positive attitude is the most important human characteristic.  With a consistent positive attitude people can achieve unbelievable things.  
The man who gives his best effort is sure of success, while the man who gives less than his best is always a failure.  If you truly try your best you are in fact a success.  Life is a test to see if you can reach your maximum potential.  
Everyone is looking for quick and easy success.  Nothing worthwhile can be achieved in a short period of time.  It takes great effort over a prolonged period of time to produce anything of great quality and value.  Success seems to be a matter of hanging on after others have let go.  The first step toward success is to learn how to preserver and prevail.  Never quit or give up.  You must persevere and finish each race.  
You can't be successful if you stand alone.  We can live together as a family and succeed or live separately as fools and fail.  Where there is unity there is great strength and power.  Education and employment to a great extent is a team effort.  The key is to join a successful support group that can mentor and nurture you.  It's essential to create coalitions so people will rally around you and support you when times get tough.  
I believe that Jacob Braude once said that adversity is like a grindstone.  Adversity either grinds you down to nothing, or it polishes you up like a sparkling diamond.  Adversity causes some people to break and others to break records.  It's essential to embrace and welcome adversity into your life.  Never run from adversity but use it to motivate yourself.  A handicap is adversity which can polish you and make you shine.

On one hand I dress conservatively and have worked dutifully at the same job for nearly 20 years, just as my parents did.  On the other hand, I'd just as soon watch MTV, and play video games as do anything else. My cd case has as much, if not more, pop and rap music than that of my two teenage daughters. If it weren't for arthritis medicine, bifocals and my oldest child, who is 23, I'd forget my age.  In fact, the older I get, the more I forget about all the things I'm supposed to be.  
As a black woman who grew up in a staunchly liberal Democrat home, I find myself oddly in agreement with some of the most conservative minds.  I believe that there should be no welfare for those who are physically and mentally able to work, and that we should have prayer in schools, give unborn babies the right to live, and bomb the Hell out of countries that mess with the United States.  At the same time, I believe in affirmative action, rights for gay people, open arms for all immigrants who want to live in our country, and radical efforts to save the whales, the tree frogs, the rain forests, and anything else in our environment. 
Do these views make me liberal, or conservative? Am I a baby boomer or an X er?  The answer is yes.  At some point I have decided that labels are not important. I choose to live without them. Instead my choice is to take on issues based on what feels right and seems logical at the time.  Some call me politically and socially schizophrenic.  The divided soul within me v the conservative, liberal, baby boomer, X'er, corporate worker and video game vixen, is at peace with all of this and whatever it means.

Sometimes this group makes age 49 feel well a very old a because it gets harder and harder to keep up with their boundless energy and enthusiasm.  They even call me the 'old man'.  This summer will also mark my 25th year as a Dental Officer in the United States Army Dental Corps.  
Yes I have been on active duty with the Army since graduation from Dental School.  No scholarship a no commitment a I joined from graduate school in 1981.  You may a or may not a be surprised at the many people I meet and interact with that greet the moniker of 'Army Dentist' with the question of:  (They actually have dentists in the Army?)  or  (Why are you in the Army?'.  The inference is something must definitely be awry.  This one couldn't make it.       
I believe it is simply pride.  It is the pride I feel treating American Soldiers with expertise and acumen a to provide the young men and women serving our country with a quality of care that they may not have received if they had not enlisted in the United States Army.  I am their hometown dentist a someone that can bring back their smile, help them chew, and ultimately be healthy and happy human beings and feel better about themselves and the world they live in.   
In the Army we (the Army Dental Corps of Officers and the Army Dental Care System) are considered combat service support.  To put this in perspective there are combat units, combat service units, and finally combat service support units.  Many times we find ourselves explaining to our own customers and patients why we are in their Army!  However out patients soon realize what a benefit they have and our success is found in their resumption of normal activities and a healthy happy life following both simple and extensive treatment.  
Coming up to age 50 is not bothersome to me and the lifestyle I have chosen is not either.  The patients we care for and the Soldiers I work for are keeping me young.  Age has educated me that the pride that I have in service to my fellow Soldiers is why and if my friends and relatives do not understand then I simply cannot explain it to them.

I am a U. S. Army Recruiter.  When I think of that title, I sometimes have to laugh.  It is a job whose name summons visions of green-suited salesmen pressing unsuspecting civilians into service.  It isn't like that at all.
I enlisted in the Army almost 20 years ago.  I was a senior in high school, and like most young adults, I didn't realize that having a plan to success was important.  I did know that I would soon be expected to achieve my own way in the world and that I didn't have the resources or desire to attend college.  It wasn't hard to make the next step a visit to the military recruiting services.  I requested several hard-to-get positions first:  Officer Candidate, Trombonist, anything that wouldn't require deployment to (the field).
What I received was an Army Recruiter who listened to me, showed me why I was not eligible for an officer candidacy, and allowed me to audition for the United States Army Band.  He also insisted that I choose a job to enlist in should I fail the audition.  I became a Satellite Communications Technician and excelled in that work.
Over the past nineteen years I have had several chances to leave the Army.  I turned each of them down.  As a Soldier, I believe that I have realized the responsibility of service at a level that most citizens don't get to enjoy.  I have seen the result of my work on the nightly news as well as in emails, and phone calls from my Soldiers stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I have deployed communication resources overnight to save lives around the world and I have stood ready to defend our country on the digital battlefield.
I have been a technician, a planner, an instructor, and a leader who instills the importance of our operations in my troops.  The decision to request duty as an Army Recruiter was easy.  It is a position that challenges me each day to guide, motivate and assist young men and women in my own community as they attempt to better themselves.  As an Army Recruiter I have a chance to share the opportunity that my recruiter provided me:  The joy of serving my fellow Americans.

The Power of the Insignificant 
Driving to work one February morning 35 years ago, I passed a herd of Black Angus cattle in a pasture.  I had driven by these same cows daily, but this time I saw something that gave me pause.  A tall, white bird was sitting on the back of one of the cows.  I pulled over and looked carefully.  There were 20 birds mixed in with the cattle.  Several sat on backs; others wandered between and underneath cows.  Later that day, during my lunch break, I went to the local book store and bought the small, Golden Book of North American Birds.  I quickly identified the critter, the cattle egret.  Several weeks after buying the book, I purchased binoculars.  The binoculars opened my eyes to dozens of species of birds in my own backyard I had never noticed before.  Soon I had a new and bigger bird book and a hobby that I still enjoy after 35 years. 
Ten years later a student at the boarding school where I taught left a beat-up mountain bike behind the dorms when he went home at the end of the school year.  I rescued the bike, put new tubes in it, and started taking mourning rides.  Today I am an avid biker.  I find peace, excitement, joy, satisfaction, and great exercise riding.
Two inconsequential events·stopping to look at birds on a cow and using an abandoned bike for a morning ride·enriched my life.  How important is the apparently insignificant?  
When I was in college, a friend wanted to introduce me to a family he had met.  (You can't believe this family,) he said.  (Ten kids, no money, but they are fat happy.)  They rented a rundown farm south of town, and my friend asked me to join him in helping them put up some hay.  We worked for a home-cooked meal, which wasn't a bad wage considering the college fare we normally ate.  As we drove home that night, my buddy said, (Did you watch that couple.  I bet he made love to her ten times while we were there.)  I hadn't noticed, but I did a quick mental review.  They joked together constantly; he frequently patted her hand as he walked by.  Together they fixed the meal, cleared the table, and washed the dishes.  Those little actions were indeed 'love making.'  They proclaimed (I love you) louder than any words, louder even than diamond rings and Caribbean cruises.  
Guy Maupassant once wrote, (The most insignificant thing contains some little unknown element.  We must find it.)  I believe that the unknown element is power, the power to enrich our lives.  I believe the secret of happiness lives in openness to the small and insignificant.

010537.txt,Christine,,50 - 65,"Nehalem, Oregon","February 2, 2006",2006,This I Believe,respect,"I believe: Thou Shalt Not Kill.  
People used to say of me as a child, (She loves animals.)  Actually that wasn't true.  I didn't love cows or fish or hens–I just couldn't eat them . . . any more than I could have eaten the dog. 
As a teenager, I thought I was mad.  After all, nobody else felt or behaved this way.  (You mean, you don't even eat honey!)  
And then a book came out, and I came out, like a gay person busting through the closet walls. 
A philosopher half-way around the world had put into words precisely what I believed.  I wasn't loony after all!  And I wasn't alone.  
According to Peter Singer's book Animal Liberation, I believed ""Thou Shalt Not Kill.""  Only the Animal Rights version, not the King James version.  Apparently I had extended my circle of compassion to include all sentient species, not just my own.  Put another way, forget animal rights–where do I get off believing I have the right to inflict pain or fear on any body?  
Thou Shalt Not Kill has guided me since first I read Singer's book and always will.  It seems to have the same effect on everyone who reads it.  
How does Thou Shalt Not Kill translate into my daily life?  Easily and joyously.  I start each day with the goal of never harming or causing any other being to suffer on my account, by trying to put myself in another's shoes, scales, paws, feathers.  For example, I try to imagine how hideously it must hurt to be caught in a leghold trap; the anguish a parrot must suffer alone in a cage, when she should be flying with her flock through the jungle; how terrible must be the life of a whale who, instead of roaming thousands of miles in the wild, is incarcerated in a tank to be applauded when he performs some undignified trick.  I try to imagine–but cannot possibly–the agony of being experimented on year after year until death at last brings blessed release.  I try to imagine how terrifying it must be, forced into a slaughterhouse to smell and sense and hear the death of family and friends, knowing that I'm next and that there can be no escape.  
I wonder, if children were taught Thou Really Shalt Not Kill–rather than 'might makes right'–what sort of world would I be living in?  How could the children possibly grow up to hate, torture, or murder other humans?  How could they possibly grow up to warmonger?  At least they wouldn't grow up with that sentimental attitude toward animals that is the cause of so much cruelty and suffering . . . you know what I mean . . . those who call themselves (animal lovers) while tucking into a turkey sandwich.  
Another great writer, Tolstoy, expressed it best when he wrote: as long as there are slaughterhouses, there will be battlefields.   
Think about it.  I do, every day.

On the outside they would appear to be mean and nasty but when the situation arises they are nice and considerate.
I have no idea why people choose to dislike the world and to be mean to people for no reason; I just know that if you choose to be mean than you will come off as mean and when you finally choose to be a good person, you shine and a make a difference in another persons life and it might make a difference in your own life.	
While on the highway to my dentist appointment, I witnessed a situation that proves my theory, while driving I watched as a man in a blue car cut off, honked, and flipped off multiple cars that were going too slow to his standards. As he came upon a lady probably in her late fifties he started honking and trying to get around her, at the moment he got into the passing lane the lady's tire popped and she started swerving he immediately slammed on his breaks and pulled over to the shoulder of the road and quietly and calmly got out of his car and helped her change her tire. This surprised me to see the man that just flipped me off and was just honking at that lady that he was helping change a flat tire, stop and help her after all his rudeness he turned out to be a really nice guy and have a good heart. 
I believe that all people are good at heart and in bad situations they can change in an instant. This story just proves to me that the theory and that the good in people comes out in the worst of situation when people are in need.
When you come across a person who is in a mad mood and is not being nice to anyone around them, just give them time and a chance to prove to you that they are really a good person a heart and that everyone deserves a second chance.

Not beleiveing that everyon in this world is racist is being naive. As they say, September 11th had a profound effect on everyone, and it certainly did with me. To put the experience simply, it didn't matter that I was born here or that I spoke English well, or that I'm not even from the same region of the world as the men who comitted the attacks. All that mattered was the color of my skin. People who would talk to me in the past wouldn't talk to me anymore, and those who didn't talk to me anyway now had a sure fire reason not to. Then there were the references to being related to terrorists and terrorism. Those hurt a lot, and there was no one there to help me but myself.

A sea of it in all directions: my whiting out days, ironically filled with country music in the background and fits of how ""rap is crap"", I ended up facing it all: ignorance and discrimination have no end in this world, and never will.
I beleive that, the choice actions of others and their remarks to me, combined with my naive mind, which rendered me unable to cope at the time, had changed me. Because of that unwanted change, I lost the opportunity to know a lot of interesting people over the course of my young life, both here and abroad. The damage has been done. I am no longer the student with the perfect 4.0, the vice-president of Student Council, or the person who played tennis and could have gotten far it in, solely because of the fact that I couldn't play any other sport if my life depended on it. But even through all of the downtimes, and the hardships that are sure to fllow, one by one with an unpredictable yet eloquently disgusting fashion, I am still growing wiser with each one that passes me by, and I am still standing, still breathing, and still living.

Mom and I waited in the Delta line, and after 10 minutes we reached the main desk and began the usual check-in routine with the standard questions asked, (How many bags are you checking in?  Can I see your I.D.?)  Everything seemed to be standard and routine in the airport.  We made our way to the securities line when something caught our eyes.  A young soldier, dressed in his tan camouflage, was hugging his father.  He looked about my age, 18 years young, and both of us seemed at that turning point in our lives: me, thinking about a new life in college hundreds of miles from home, and him- boarding a plane to his new dangerous life- thousands of miles from home.  The father was hugging his son tightly, his eyes, firmly shut, and his mouth muttering words that looked as if he was praying or blessing his child.  
   It was a three second glance, but that was all it took for mom and I to start empathizing with the father and the son.  As soon as we passed them, we took a look at each other and recognized that both of us were taken aback by the scene, shared tears in our eyes.  
    Standing in the securities line, I had an epiphany of the desperate need to support our troops.  For the first time in my life, I saw that these were real people risking their lives in their beliefs of what was right for the country.  I believe that no matter what your beliefs are in the Iraq war, we must unite as a country to support our troops, for these are real people that have real families and real friends.    
   I know that everyone has heard the phrase or seen it on hundreds of cars, but (Support the Troops) has significance in my heart now.  I could not have gotten it from the news team with their multiple headlines over what is occurring in Iraq today; my true realization came from putting a face value on one soldier.  The most ironic part of it all was that this emotional occurrence happened in a place where most often people don't give each other a second glance.  Most travelers are concerned with their next destination, not with what is occurring in other people's lives.    
   Now, I always think about that soldier in the Atlanta airport.  I wonder sometimes if he is scared in Iraq like I would be if I were there.  I wonder if he is alive, or wounded, or worse yet, dead.  I find myself praying for him every night as well as the thousands of other soldiers in Iraq.  As I have recently discovered, I believe the rest of the nation should support our troops-better yet, our fellow brothers- in the Iraq War.

011417.txt,Catheryn,,30 - 50,"Montpelier, Virginia","March 2, 2006",2006,This I Believe,,"I believe that majoring in English literature was one of the smartest things I've ever done.  
And when I chose my major, I was operating totally on intuition.  I had no idea the value of the skills I was going to receive. 
I'll never forget how one of my professors accidentally taught me this lesson.  He did not teach English, but  was an accounting professor.  After my degree in literature, I went back to school for a post baccalaureate in Accounting and this was my very first class in the program.  He stood up in front of the class on the first day, introduced himself and gave us a short introduction speech on the great value of accounting systems and double entry bookkeeping.  He informed us that the systematic and measured approaches to the world of accounting and finance were the apex, the critical mass, of the business world.  (It's all in the numbers, folks.  Accounting is the language of business) he said.  And the class shook their heads in agreement.  But then he proceeded to say, (Now, if you want to interpret the business world, like say, some English major (and I quote) and go at it in some free form stylea.).  
It took a few minutes to get over the initial slap in the face from that comment.  But after a few minutes, the reality started to come into view.  Would this man, a tenured professor, actually sit down to a piece of paper to write a critical business correspondence, or an academic article, and just scrawl out some (free form) words that might do the job, but might not?  I would argue certainly not. There are grammar structures to be considered and the connotation of words that might or might not prove appropriate for the context of such a document.  And how about the logic of his point of view?  Is it solid or is it an exercise in rationalization and verbal diarrhea?  
I'm sure that if I had brought these observations to his attention, he would have agreed with me that he had indeed underestimated the power of the well written word. At least I hope so.  But during my life as an English major, I learned so much about what good writing is all about.  And as any good English teacher will tell you, writing is thinking, and good thinking makes for good writing.  Maybe that accounting professor just needed to sit down and do more writing.  Then he'd see how ludicrous his statement really was.
Writing and reading and critical analysis teaches one the incredible value of  quality writing.  The people I know that value these things are typically more conscientious voters. They like to ask better questions about what they read and tend to follow better logic when they hear someone proselytize about the way things ought to be. They make for fascinating cocktail conversation too. And they are usually much better at spelling.
But what really gives me a kick out of my educational choice is when I'm listening to Garrison Keillor and Company on Public Radio and they do a funny skit about English majors.  I just laugh and laugh and laugh!

""I'm gay.""
It was early, around two or three a.m. shortly after Thanksgiving, when my mother told me over the phone. I gagged; it was like a reflex after a near-death collision. Years of pent-up aggression and adrenaline crashed out of my system. I wanted to vomit. And to have her hold me.
At the time I was deep in a manic-depressive cycle (though I did not know it then), and I was suicidal. As I lay curled into the fetal position on my bed, in a full panic attack, my wife forced me to call my mother. Why my mother? Because despite everything she had put us through, she was still the only person I could remotely consider sharing my own shame and fear with.
For a long time I carried inside myself a terrible weight of anger at my mother's apparent abandonment of my family and me when she suddenly moved out of the house when I was twenty-five. I tried to prod my mom to tell me what was wrong. But all I got in return was a fist-clenching tantrum and blood-curdling moan begging us to stop pushing her to tell us if she was coming home and to stop pushing her to talk about what was going on inside. Even worse than these moments was the silence that followed: the weeks without contact, knowing only that mom was suffering and that I didn't know how to help. And that she would not, could not, tell me why.
Then early that November morning, after calling her to demand answers because I was scared and suicidal, and because I needed her, she told me. She moaned the words, like she was giving birth to them: ""I'm gay.""
I burst into tears, gulping air into my lungs. But from somewhere just as deep came a sense of relief with each shudder of my body. ""Finally,"" I thought, ""an explanation!"" And that meant a means to reconnect with her. She was different now, but somehow more herself than ever.
This experience changed us all—my parents, my siblings, and me. It shattered the masks behind which we had hidden our deepest selves from one another. And when we saw one another—raw and vulnerable—we reacted by offering support and forgiveness. We didn't run away in fear that seeing the truth might expose our own frailties to one another. We let go of our illusions: my mother and father about their marriage and me about my own, which later ended in divorce. We saw in the letting go that there was a new love waiting beyond the illusion.
So I believe in the power of people to forgive and the survival of the love between them through even the most wrenching assaults of anger and mistrust. Although the classically ""nuclear"" family in which I was raised would never again exist as it had, I believe it will survive the divorce of my parents. My father—the man with whom my mother bore me, three other sons, and a daughter, and whose hand she held as two of those sons were buried—has come to forgive her and understand her. And love her.
So whatever else is to come, I believe that this forgiveness of one another will bind us together as a new family, in a new form with new members. The essence at the heart of that love will be there: acceptance.

(What's wrong?) I asked.
(I think that your darling, darling mother is dead.)
That was the moment that my mother, my self, and my past all disappeared. The fireman came. The services were held. We all tried to be strong. And I did know, theoretically, that someone had once been that girl who had a mother. But it could not have been I.
A few months later, while going through my desk drawers, I came across a little corner of blue paper sticking up from a box of markers and crayons, waxy from years of living sandwiched between Brick Red and Robin's Egg Blue. I pinched the paper with my fingernails, and tugged it out. It was a letter from my mother, sent to me while I was at camp, six years earlier. (I will send kisses to the moon for you tonight,) she had written.
And right then v for a moment v I remembered.
I believe in letters, because I believe in remembering. In my work at a prominent research library, I read letters almost every day, and almost every day, through them, I become intimately involved with another human being. I hear their words in my head; I feel the creases they made in the stationary; I see where their tears of agony and of love have warped the paper and blurred the ink. One of my colleagues says that she now knows six men, personally, who died at the Battle of Fredericksburg v not because she somehow was there that December in 1862, but because she knows, as their wives and their friends did, the shock of that fourteenth letter, written in an unfamiliar hand: (I am sorry to inform you that your husband died of diarrhea on the 16tha)  
Letters, you see v for understanding the humanity of all people, in all places and in all times v are nothing less than precious. In fact, they are indispensable.
Still, they do seem to be on their way out. And there are other ways of connecting the present to the past: videos, audio recordings, even data sets. But it is inexcusably foolish to throw away our old, written forms, with their pre-meditated expressions, their personal handwriting (or even typescript), their long-distance deliberations, and yes, their tearstains, simply because they take up time and paper; or, even worse, because they are no longer new. 
In high school I learned that absurdity can be defined as (man cut off from his roots.) That is a dangerous, dangerous thing. And so this I truly believe: when the time comes to look, there should be something for every child to find in his or her crayon box.

If we fail to understand and appreciate their sacrifice, we will soon begin to take our freedoms for granted.  And, if we take our freedoms for granted, then I believe that our nation will become vulnerable.
Since the Revolutionary War, nearly one million men and women have died serving our country to protect our freedoms.  An additional 1.4 million soldiers have received non-mortal wounds, like my mother's uncle, John.
John served in the 4th Infantry Division in World War II and he took part in many battles, earning a Purple Heart, Silver Star, Bronze Star with three clusters and an arrowhead for landing on a beachhead.  As a senior in high school John and his classmates were quarantined at home due to a scarlet fever outbreak.  To help support his family he went to work.  Before he could return to finish high school he was conscripted into the U.S. Army.  John stormed Utah Beach on D-Day and several days later he was hit by shrapnel.  After lying in a ditch through the night listening to the artillery fire over his head he was rescued and sent to a hospital in England.  He recovered, returned to battle, and was hit again by shrapnel.  This time his life was spared when the shrapnel hit a tin of Nescafe coffee in his pocket that his wife had sent to him.  I asked him why he served, and he said simply that it was his duty to his country.
I believe that we must take action to remember the sacrifice of those who have served our country.  I believe that we must teach our children to appreciate that they have many freedoms because of the sacrifices of these soldiers.  We are free to express ourselves and our beliefs.  We are free to choose who we worship and how we worship.  We are free to pursue economic prosperity to satisfy our needs and to help others who are less fortunate.  We are free from fear.    
We were fortunate that John was still living so that we could thank him for serving our country and protecting our freedoms.  Sixty three years after he was conscripted into the Army, he lamented to my father that he regretted never receiving his high school diploma.  My father learned of a special program offered by John's school district that awards high school diplomas based on lifetime service to veterans who did not graduate as a result of their military service.  John received his diploma at a surprise graduation ceremony during an emotional school board meeting and I took the initiative to tell his story of unselfish service and sacrifice.  His tearful acceptance will always serve as a reminder to me to appreciate the freedoms that I used to take for granted.

They try to do what's right, but in the process everything changes, and the whole idea of doing what's right is lost.  
     It's the same thing as John F.Kennedy said in Berlin (Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free.)  The internet is everyone's, I can now go into a Star Bucks and go on the internet without any restrictions.  Yes I know there are limitations, and not everyone would follow the rules, but by blocking certain words like game, it limits me from finding important information such as baseball, and baseball players.  The problem with blocking access to the internet sites is that I have to find ways around it. This tends to make the administration angry, and in return they try to find more ways to stop it.  I believe WebSense should be fixed to allow us more freedom, and the administration should do a better job of screening words that do not get negative results in their eyes.

I am sure there are many reasons but the fact is that most men do this and then find themselves alone in middle age. We may have work friends, church friends and some sports friends and even some drinking friends but this amounts to little of value. What we need are friends where we can share and talk and meet in a non competitive and non-judgmental place. I believe strongly that in the absence of this: neurosis, loneliness and dependency builds to nearly unbearable levels. Our problems magnify in isolation and when we can share them, we understand that we are not alone.
It is one of the tragedies of our times that men have abandoned understanding of the importance of this. The men's group movement recognized this and most people who laughed at the suggestion that affluent white men needed support, just never had a clue what it was all about. It was never just about affluent white men, it was about all men.
I offer you the books of Iron John by Robert Bligh or Fire in the Belly by Sam Keene. These books have begun the journey of many men and offer a powerful introduction.
Early in my life a sea captain/mentor gave me this advice. We were sailing offshore and during the peace of a late night watch, he convinced me to make the effort to stay close to my friends. His words came from a place of intense loneliness that only a world wandering sailor can understand. I heard him clearly and for this reason am blessed to have good friends from as early as second grade. I keep the friends I can talk with, friends I can tell I love, and friends who will find the time to listen and often say nothing. It takes some work, but much less then you might suspect. I am not sure I would have survived my life's trials without them. I have found that given the pervasive loneliness of today's men, it's never too late to resurrect old acquaintances. It just takes reasonable expectations and the willingness to put aside some fears.
I recently read Doris Kearn Goodwin's book about Abraham Lincoln named Team of Rivals. I was struck by the way men wrote to one another expressing their love in passionate ways that today would be mistakenly classified as gay. They understood the importance of friends and without email or phones worked to maintain them. Nurture your old friendships, keep them close or find a men's group near you but come back, we need you.

012239.txt,Katie,,18 - 30,"Port Orchard, Washington","March 31, 2006",2006,This I Believe,democracy;freedom;government & constitution,"The First Amendment of our Bill of Rights gives us the right to speak freely. I believe this right is crucial in every aspect of our lives. Other countries may view this as a gift, but as Americans we believe it is our right to be able to express ourselves as human beings and citizens of the United States. There have been many great leaders, presidents, and peaceful protestors who have shown us how to practice our right to voice our opinions. 
	President Kennedy was a man of many words. He provoked many thoughts in not only the people of the United States, but of foreign countries too. In his Berlin speech in 1961 concerning the separation of the city of Berlin from the rest of Germany,  Kennedy spoke of freedom for the city; that (The freedom of the city is not negotiable. We cannot negotiate with those who say, 'What's mine is mine, and what's yours is negotiable.) Kennedy practiced his right to express his opinion bravely. So bravely that he took his right to freedom of speech out of its borders to assist those who did not have the same gifts of freedom.
	Possibly the most famous speech in history, and one of the most risky, is Martin Luther King Jr.'s (I Have a Dream Speech). King believed that being silent about your beliefs will get you nothing. No respect, no place in society, and no rights. One of the most powerful beliefs King ever stated says, (Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.) I believe this statement holds truth to all of human existence. We will not gain our necessities until we ask for them. We will not be heard until one voice takes the first step. We will gain nothing and deny ourselves our rights as humans if we keep silent. King believed these things where true when the majority of America did not. He won millions of people their rights because he understood the importance of utilizing our Freedom of Speech. 
	Joseph McCarthy was a bold Senator. He thought that his right to speak freely allowed him to jeopardize the rights of others. Over 250 well-to-do citizens were accused by McCarthy of being Communists in the 1950's. When proven innocent they were sent back into society blacklisted and unable to be recognized as true Americans. McCarthy stripped them of their rights by abusing his own right of Freedom of Speech. One important voice was truly heard through what was called (McCarthyism). That is the voice of radio broadcaster Edward R. Murrow. (This is not time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent·or for those who approve,) was Murrow's main point. He believed that everyone had the right to state what they believed. He believed it was not McCarthy's place to say who was allowed to have certain opinions. 
	All of these leaders practiced what I believe to be the most important right in American History. Without it, their speeches may have not existed. We would be short of many deserved rights. The United States would have lack of character, lack of necessities, and lack of opinion. I believe that without freedom to have a voice, we have nothing.

012399.txt,Candace,,30 - 50,"Camden, South Carolina","April 5, 2006",2006,God Welcomes Us,faith & religion;self-determination;self-knowledge;tolerance;values & spirituality,"""You're a false shepherd, ma'am, leading people to hell!"" the protester yelled as I walked by him to get to my car. 
As his verbal assault continued behind me I had to marvel at how protesters in the South still remembered their manners when yelling insults at a woman – even a woman in collar.
The church in Columbia, South Carolina where I serve as assistant pastor had just broken ground on a new building and we had drawn the ire of these protesters. You see, our church, Garden of Grace United Church, is predominantly gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender and to some that is anathema to being Christian. At least it was to these protesters who were so sure that I was helping to lead our flock to the fiery pit. 
As the daughter of a Southern Baptist minister I know the beliefs of these protesters like the back of my hand. I understand where their rage comes from when confronted by a gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender person. That rage – rooted in fear – used to be my rage, only pointed inward and not outward. I was angry, not just at God but at myself, for not being able to will myself to be ""normal"" like all the other kids in school. 
It took me years of earnest searching to finally reconcile my sexuality and my spirituality and arrive at a place where I knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt that my sexual orientation was given to me by God, to be used with integrity and fidelity. That assurance led me to found an Internet magazine for GLBT Christians called ""Whosoever.org"" and then led me into seminary to follow in my father's footsteps and become a minister. 
But, that rage is never far behind. It continues to haunt me, testing my faith and tempting me to go back to doubting. The protesters were a temptation – beckoning me to lash out in anger, revealing to them and to myself that I had not yet come to a place of peace with my own beliefs. I had given in to this temptation before, going nose to nose with protesters as we called each other everything but a child of God. 
This spring afternoon was different, however. The protesters continued their taunts behind me but the scene before me revealed my partner of five years, her arms open to receive me, her smile warm and inviting. I believe that's how God looks in those moments when doubts assail us with raised voices and tempt us to strike out in fear and anger at those who may disagree with us. God smiles, opens her arms and welcomes us with unconditional love and a grace large enough to enfold even those who would shout us down, whether or not they remember their manners.

You are never too old to educate yourself and
Pursue your dreams.
You have to know who you are in terms of ethics, values and secret dreams.  Know what motivates you, devise a plan to achieve your dreams and then pursue them.  
During my corporate selling career, I had to endure a hostile work environment in order to get my experience and move on.  My client roster included Sony, U.S. Geological Survey, Visa, start-ups and many other companies varied in size.  Unfortunately, as I moved up the totem pole of prestigious sales, each succeeding company became more unethical than the previous.  
Selling ""vaporware"" was the last straw – I quickly realized the service wasn't going to exist so I quit on the spot.  It crossed my line for ethics I hold dear.  I made a vow to never work in the corporate arena again.
You might say, the past three years, I have been on a journey. I have come to terms with who I am, my passions, and how I might give back to the community at large. Finally, I realize I am unstoppable when I set my mind to it.   
Three years ago, I was waiting for my husband to retire.  We sold our home and moved.  I had nothing to do with my time, so I began my company.  My daughter, who heard most of my sales tales woes and moments of genius, named it ""Smooth Sale"".  According to her, I can fix any detrimental situation and turn it around into a sale.  My tag line is, ""I hoist your sales!""
Smooth Sale is a professional sales training company devoted to helping entrepreneurs and beginning salespeople build their business more quickly.  My work is based upon my corporate sales life revealing insider secrets, and both good and bad experiences for others to learn by example.  
Every marketing piece I read said to write a book.  So I wrote a book and self-published.  A few social friends suggested, ""Anyone can self-publish; having a legitimate publisher is a different league."" 
Undeterred and motivated, I hired an agent, found a publisher and secured an advance. I'm now legitimate.  The new book will be on local bookshelves this fall. 
Meanwhile, my four new projects are:  
– Formalizing material for a second book;
– Licensing my workshop materials; 
– Hosting an internet and satellite radio show; 
– Speaking at large conventions across the country
Colleagues tell me, ""You are advancing at lightning speed!""  My new mantra is, ""If not now, when!""   
If it sounds like a good idea, I pursue it.  It's okay to change course if it doesn't work.  But, if I don't try, I will never know if I could have achieved my dreams.  
I have achieved more than I ever dreamt.  And, I have learned that I now need to dream bigger.  Life is a wonderful journey.  The rewards can be yours if you just say, ""Yes""!

012866.txt,Jeff,,18 - 30,"Croydon, Pennsylvania","April 21, 2006",2006,This I Believe,sports,"Stay for the whole game. What does this mean? It truly means that if you hang around in life and grind out those tough situations, you will have no regrets. Even if you do have regrets, at least you were there to experience the entire situation.  It means not taking the easy way out. It is a principle I have lived by ever since I was eight years old.
Our friend Paul had his father take our group of friends to a major league baseball game. Our team was losing by six runs late in the game. Now Paul was the biggest fan out of all of us and was absolutely miserable over this score. He whined and complained for his dad to take us home immediately. His father gave in, and I will remember that car ride home for the rest of my life. Listening on the radio, we heard ""what an amazing comeback"". Our team had scored seven runs in the final inning and won the game. Paul was in tears. He vowed from that day on that he would never leave another game before it was over. 
Looking back now, as I have grown up and matured, I can truly say that was a life changing experience that gave me a better outlook. . It is amazing what you can experience by being there until the end. In any task I take on I always go out of the way to put in the full effort to complete it. I feel it is also a statement of determination and not quitting. Anytime a difficult situation arises and I want to quit, such as when I am watching my team lose and I just want to break the television, I think back to that horrible car ride home. It goes along with what you deal with growing up. You always got into less trouble taking the hard way out and being truthful rather than lying. In conclusion ""stay for the whole game"" to me means do not take the easy way out. To this day none of us have ever left another game early.

013108.txt,Nick,,Under 18,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","April 28, 2006",2006,This I Believe,self-determination;work,"Many people seem to be content with riding on the coattails or otherwise leeching off of other's hard work. However, when required to do something on their own, they create something truly lackluster and hardly worth even mentioning. Leaning too much on others will only make one weaker. Those who choose to forge their own paths, to break away from the masses, and to do something unique – something that they can call their own – are those who will find successful lives. I believe that individuality is the most important trait a person can possess. 
	For me, being individualistic does not mean that I completely ignore or refuse others' help; it simply means that I wish to experience the many mysteries of life through my own work. It also means that I strive to find new and unique solutions to problems; I look for ways to express my own ideas, as opposed to simply rehashing an old one. This drive to follow my own path has greatly influenced my short life. Most teenagers are forced to get a job by their parents for an array of reasons – a need for an extra curricular, a desperate desire for some extra cash, an overabundance of free time et al. Thus, all of my friends decided to work at the local swim club over the summer. My natural inclination was, of course, to go over and join in the merriment and (rather meager) money-making with them. However, I ultimately decided that I could do something much more interesting, constructive and lucrative with my time. Somehow, I managed to convince my parents that I could make a greater sum of money than my friends by selling items on the internet. The end result is now, about two years later, I make seven hundred dollars or more per month, every month of the year. Not only did my choice to ""split from the pack"" result in an increase in my disposable income, but my business experiences will be invaluable down the road. Having no one to rely on but myself and having no one there to assist me when I mess up has proved to be the greatest teacher of all. The knowledge I've gained from my internet exploits has been immeasurably more helpful than spending my summer lounging around the pool.
	Following other people and making decisions based upon their actions is just too much of a gamble. While it is true that I can learn a great many things from others, relying on their rhetoric and subsequently mimicking their every move would have severely hampered my opportunities and future success. Afterall, if this is my life, then why should I try to live the life of someone else? That is why I believe that individualism, above all else, is the most vital characteristic for people to embrace.

I met him when I was 19, married him at 20 and we were separated when I turned 22 because he was arrested for and then convicted of a violent crime. He had failed himself, his family, his wife and his future, but he was my husband. I was mad, sad, disappointed and frightened, but I loved him, and he needed me, so I stayed.
I stayed through weeks of trials, years in jail and decades in prison. I have faith in the covenant of marriage and of the God we stood before when we took those vows. I have faith in my husband and his ability to grow and change and become a better man, no matter where he is — and he has. I have faith that time makes changes in us all we cannot avoid or ignore.
I am now 50. He is 55. He is still my husband and my best friend. I see him four hours every weekend and I talk to him on the phone twice a week for 20 minutes. I am not deceived or a martyr. I am not stupid, uneducated or desperate. I am a wife. I work, have a mortgage, a 9-year-old car, two dogs and bills just like everyone else. This is so close to me, it is hard sometimes to realize I am only one wife of over 2 million people who live behind bars. I have not made many friends at the prison. I keep that part of my life separate, but it's always there — always a part of every decision and choice I make.
Somewhere in here I think I'm supposed to say I believe my husband is innocent, that the system didn't work and we're victims of whatever, but that isn't the point. How do we choose what crime is over the edge, or what sin is too great to be forgiven? Yes, I get angry at the situation. I have grieved the loss of many of the normal things others have done, like having children and vacations abroad. This is not the life I would have expected for myself 30 years ago and it isn't one I recommend to others, but it is my life.
At 50, I have come to the conclusion it is not the life I have that defines me, it is the way I choose to live that life. I choose to live it being faithful. This brings me peace, this allows me to have joy, this keeps me aware of my husband. My spiritual faith has given me the foundation to live this life, not just survive it. Faith in a God who has not abandoned me; faith in a man who loves me; faith in myself. I believe in faithfulness.

013370.txt,Benjamin,,18 - 30,"Oakland City, Indiana","May 8, 2006",2006,This I Believe,hope;setbacks,"I always love to read to Peanuts in the comic strip.  Snoopy, Linus, Schroeder, and the rest were great friends to me when I was growing up.  And of course there was Charlie Brown, a character everyone loves and admires.  Well, the readers do anyway.  It seems he gets a lot of grief from his own friends.
It wasn't until the past year that I realized how important that grief has always been to me.  The best example is the recurring theme of kicking the football.  Lucy, a character who has seemingly made it her life's purpose to give others grief has found an easy target in Charlie Brown.  He never seems to wise up to her tricks.  She offers to hold a football for him to run and kick.  Charlie Brown comes running with a Herculean effort hell-bent on kicking that ball half-way to the moon.  Lucy pulls the ball away at the last minute and Charlie Brown finds himself flying through the air crying ""AAAGGH!!!"" and landing with a capital ""WHUMP.""
This strip paints a very good portrait of how I view life.  I think it is important to try to go for my dreams even when I know I am likely to fail.  Charlie Brown isn't the fool Lucy would have us take him for.  He knows that she will pull the ball away and he will once more fall back to earth with bruises to more than his body.  It's absurd to think she will do otherwise.  But that's what makes the action important, and that's the first part of the formula for living an authentic life.  I pursue my dreams despite the absurdity.
I can flaunt this absurdity because even though I believe one-hundred percent that I will fail to realize my dreams, I also believe one-hundred percent that my dreams will come true.  The math may be fuzzy, but it works for me.  Simultaneous optimism and pessimism prevents me from being locked in either viewpoint and allows me to act without pretense, lying to myself, or relying on a deus ex machine .  
The last ingredient is the one that ties it all together.  Charlie Brown feels an intense moment of grief when he's lying on the ground with his dream of kicking the football lying in shattered pieces all around him.  Grief is important to him and to me because it makes the effort worth it.  The possibility of happiness means nothing without the possibility of grief.  Denying the importance of grief can lead me to have an overly optimistic view of life, thereby missing out on a large part of existence.  So this is what I believe—I believe in pursuing my dreams despite the absurdity and the impending grief.  I choose to kick the football.

013453.txt,Matthew,,18 - 30,"Rolling Meadows, Illinois","May 10, 2006",2006,This I Believe,self-determination,"I believe that life is a chain defining events, each one subsequent to the next. These events are set in a particular order and are completely inevitable. No experience can pertain to any social position, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. All pleasures and sufferings occur, solely, to mold you into the being that you are inevitably going to become. For me, fate is a reality. You are who you are completely by fate. Since you have no control of what happens to you, you have no control of your memories. Memory is how you learn. You have no control of what you learn; therefore, you have no control over your thoughts.
	I believe that every religion explains existence; therefore, all religions may be correct. An agnostic doubts everything. I do not doubt anything. If all beliefs are accepted as possible, then they may all work together. I can believe that a God created the first cell; the one that eventually evolved into the human race. I can also believe that there was once a Jesus Christ who came to bring faith to that race. And simultaneously, I can believe that we are beings of energy. And the energy that we give off pushes the world around. The Buddhist term Karma can explain reality in the same way as modern physics.   
When I am at work, the customer's mood can negatively affect my own mood, just as a generous driver on the highway can lift my spirits. This shows the chain of events where fate finds foundation. All experiences, all events or emotions, spawn from something else. The world is an endless chain of cause and effect. 
	I believe that due to this chain, God must be fate. Perhaps a wealthy businessman is laid off from his job. Maybe that causes the him to begin drinking and beating his children. Then perhaps one of his children grows to be a mass murderer or a rapist. All events are relevant. One thing leads into another.
	In many ways, I believe it is absolutely impossible to control what you believe, or who you become; however, I notice that people do attempt to change who they are. Although this is all part of the big chain of cause and effect, the discontent that people feel about their own character is only  an unnecessary and negative emotion. The paradigm that a person as such creates is harsh, and the problems from which that paradigm exists are inevitably characteristic of the person in discontent. I believe that no matter what life throws at you, you must take it as an individual. No person has the ability to stray from their natural person, so be content with who you are and work with what you got.

In the early month of my high school career I often envied people who did not care. They didn't care about their grades, about doing homework of completing projects or how they did on the tests. Instead of doing their schoolwork they had fun talking to each other, wasting time and avoiding work at all costs. Sometimes I thought myself: ""Why bother?"" I thought that the only purpose of good grades was to please my parents and maybe my teachers. I didn't think it would pay off in the future as I didn't see immediate benefits. I had my periods of laziness but in general I worked hard. 
By the end of my junior year I got a pleasant surprise. Colleges started sending their information to me saying things like this: ""We think that you might be a good fit for our intellectual community"" My SAT score came out to be fairly high and I think it had a lot to do with the amount of effort I put forward in school. In my college selection process I had a luxury of a wide choice of schools to attend, and a comfort of knowing that I will be admitted at least at some colleges I applied to. Payoff continued when I received a scholarship from a college I wanted to go to. 
	Now as a senior at the end of the school year I look back at the high school and I realize that none of my effort was wasted. This makes me feel optimistic about the future. I know that success in life has less to do with luck and more to do with the effort you put in it.

014627.txt,Juliet,,30 - 50,"Tucson, Arizona","June 15, 2006",2006,This I Believe,nature,"There is a hummingbird nest in a huge Scotch pine tree just outside of our dining room window.  I check on it every morning while I'm eating breakfast, and every night while I'm having dinner.  My daughter, Hannah, is obsessed.  She spends at least an hour a day just sitting at the table watching the hummingbird sitting on her nest, who in turn, spends that same hour watching Hannah sitting on her chair.  This is truly an amazing thing because nothing holds this girl's attention for long.
The nest itself is like a tiny sake cup nestled in amongst the very end-most twigs of the tree.  I wonder how many eggs are in there and when they'll hatch.  I also wonder how the hummingbird will feed her youngsters.  We're buying a hummingbird feeder soon so I can assure myself that our little hummer family will get enough food for their long flight north for the summer.
Back when I was still active in the pagan community, people would ask me how I had raised such inquisitive and curious children.  I was actually rather taken aback by that question.  I didn't think that I was doing anything special – aren't all children curious?  I'm just teaching them about wonder.  Wonder is an essential part of everyday life – the wonder of how a tiny acorn turns into a huge oak tree; the wonder of how some birds always return to the same nest year after year; the wonder of planting Faerie gardens and seeing tiny footprints in the morning dew; and the wonder of how kisses really do make boo-boos feel better.
Maybe it's one of the perks of being a pagan parent – seeing the wonder in even the most mundane things.  It's definitely one of the perks of being a pagan kid.  You can hold onto ""childish"" behaviour even into your adult years.  You can build monuments to Gaea using your mashed potatoes.  You believe that faeries help bread rise.  You believe that the princess wasn't rescued by the prince, but instead she rescued him and made friends with the dragon, too.
I truly believe that wonder is the most powerful of all human emotions.  Wonder is what drove ancient man to build Stonehenge and the Pyramids.  It's what drove Galileo to improve the telescope and discover that the Earth orbited the sun.  And it's what drove Alexander Fleming to discover penicillin.  Without wonder, without the urge to investigate and discover, our society would be stagnant; our society's great advances are driven by wonder.

This isn't about looking smart or well-read — it's just my way of keeping things on the up-and-up: Put your guns on the table, keep your hands and books in plain sight – it's as simple as that.  
I'm suspicious of people who don't put their books where I can see them. It makes me uncomfortable. Does this mean they don't read? And if they don't read, what am I doing in their living room?
Book collections help me get acquainted with people; they provide a kind of social shorthand. Almost as soon as I enter a new friend's home, I wander to the bookshelves to nose around and get a feel for their interests. I peer at the titles, wondering if all the Faulkner and Hemingway mean they were American-lit majors in college or if they actually kick back after dinner with ""The Old Man and the Sea."" Does the latest Ann Coulter book mean my new friend appreciates her politics, or is he just trying to understand the enemy?
And certain titles – Bret Easton Ellis' ""Less Than Zero,"" anyone? – reveal as much about your age as a driver's license. 
When I was growing up, our house was littered with reading material. My dad stashed crossword puzzles and political nonfiction on the edge of the tub; Mom stored her novels and self-help books in the bedroom, and cookbooks piled up next to the tiny kitchen TV. My bookcases were jammed with pastel-hued Judy Blume paperbacks and Noel Streatfeild's shoe series. And when I became a homeowner, I took such delight in my towering wall of books, you'd have thought I'd written and bound them myself.
Of course, just because you own a book doesn't mean you've actually read it. Quite a few ""wishful-thinking"" books have lined my shelves, including Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" and Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter."" ""Jane Eyre"" remained on my bookcase for six years before I actually got around to reading it all the way through.
We all keep a few books we aspire to read. There are the books we buy on impulse because they look so pretty, and we want to touch them and keep them close to us. Then there are the books we amass because they seem essential to any well-rounded collection. Those books reveal a lot about us, too – about whom we want to be, what we wish we knew.
Of course, like most people who hold strong convictions, I don't always practice what I preach. For the last two years, I've lived in a tight space; unpacking my entire book collection has been impractical. I've used the library a lot. But I'm saving up for something bigger – nothing fancy, just someplace where Noel Streatfeild can stand tall and line up next to Julia Alvarez, Dorothy Allison and, sure, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, out in the open, in the living room, for everyone to see.

There are some items in the world that get better with age.  Antiques and fine wines are collected everywhere, because their maturity makes their values increase.  On the other hand, how many people collect senior citizens?  The fact that we all die at some time or another has been around since the beginning of mankind.  As time goes away, so does our muscles, bones, and brains, so we should all try and stay as young as we can.
We haven't discovered a way to stop the flowing sands of time, so there is not a way that humans can literally stay young forever.  However, one thing we can do is stay healthy.  A lot of our elderly have health problems like, bone loss, arthritis, and bad backs, so it's important for us to keep our bodies young and in shape.  My parents and many of my friends' parents have a habit of taking naps after work.  Getting more than the recommended eight hours of sleep is partly responsible for obesity, which shortens life spans.  Instead of sleeping in on weekends, a person should exercise their bodies instead, keeping themselves healthy and young, as well as prolonging their life span.
Have you ever wondered why old people are ""wise"" and young people are ""smart""?  As we get older, our brains also deteriorate.  People who are youthful can remember a wide variety of things that they have learned, but the elderly can only remember things that have been useful in their lives.  Surely, I, having just graduated from high school, can tell you how to find the volume of the area inside of three equations rotated around an axis of x = 7, but my grandpa could tell you that you should never get married and have a live at home girlfriend instead.  Even though the elderly are a spring of wisdom, wouldn't it be better if the elderly were smart aswell as wise?
Aging takes its toll on us, even though most of the problems are our own fault.  There are a lot of little things we can do to improve our aging lives, and I hope they are worth it.  I never want to feel the aches and pains of old age, that's why I believe that we should try to stay young for as long as we can.

Before I sobered up 15 years ago I wanted to make sure that my contributions were noticed.  There were several problems with this approach; I contributed very little and when I did, the recognition I recieved was never of the right kind or the praise was alwys tinged with ghosts of my imagination.
Anonimity for me means the freedom to live by principals, not expected recognition.  When I operate on expected recognition my actions and words are always couched to acheive some end of my own creation.  
Not expecting or wanting recognition allows me the freedom to live without fear of failure.  I just do my best and move on.  Functioning in the realm of anonymity helps me live with fewer resentments and more compassion.
So, in closing, if you chose to read my quickly written essay you'll need to have someone else read it as my ego  and anonymity would be in danger if I were to read it myself.  And, you may not use my full name, only my first name.  I guess anonymity does require cooperation by others, in this case by NPR.  If this can't be honored, that's OK by me.  Not having my essay read is a small price to pay for the benefits of living anonymously at the level of press, radio and film.  And, I reminded myself once again of the life-saving value of taking the action without expecting anything in return.
It's a great world I live in, quietly manuevering along, fully engaged and just one tiny but important part of humanity.

015479.txt,Bambi,,30 - 50,"Chicago, Illinois","August 16, 2006",2006,This I Believe,community;tolerance,"I believe in community as a single fabric.  
I believe that we humans form communities to share our strength and mitigate our weaknesses.  Our Americans community consists of people of every color and nationality and native tongue and sexual orientation and artistic temperament.  And, as a community, we are all in it together.  The air I breathe is the air that you breathe.  My children are your children.  Your parents are my parents.  When you stumble, I am there to help you up and when I stumble, I know that your hand will be extended to help me in my time of need as well.
In a community of a single fabric, we teach each other's children, we care for each other's infirmed loved ones, and we all grab a bucket when there's a fire.  In a community of a single fabric, we abide by the simple truth that we do best for ourselves when we do right by others.
But the fabric of our community is not dull and bleak and gray: it is rich and bright and beautiful.  We all revel in each other's unique talents.  Whether your inner light shines out when you sing, or paint, or tell jokes, or divine the secrets of the Universe, your unique personality and the sum of your experiences add to the wonder and the glory of the fabric, and every single individual adds colors and patterns and textures to our fabric until it is the glorious interweaving story of a tapestry.
As with every story, though, there are the villains.  In this case, the villains take the form of those who would seek to divide us one from another, who would try to fan the flames of supremacy and extremism and divisiveness and anger and hate.  I believe those people weaken our community, our society, our nation, and, in the end, our very humanity.
I believe that we are all best served if we say ""NO"" those who try to drive wedges between us, and cleave all the more firmly to the community that is found in the simple human desire to share our strengths and mitigate our weaknesses.

	I believe the best thing you can do for yourself and everybody else is to make something. 
	In 1979, when I was 25, in the middle of the sweltering summer in New York City, I decided to make a quilt.  Don't ask me what got me started.  I don't remember.  I do remember that once I got a Big Idea to make a queen-sized quilt, nothing could stop me. I bought fabric from a teeny packed store on First Avenue run by a small, stooped man.  I took the fabric home, and cut and sewed all day and some of the night. At the time, I did not sew very well, but I did not let lack of skill get in my way.  Occasionally, when I had to leave my apartment for food or some other inconvenience, I always hurried through my errand so that I could return to the quilt as quickly as possible.  
	When I thought I had completed the top, the quilt disagreed.  Wait, it seemed to say, You think you're finished, but not so fast, missy!  It had big, open off-white squares between nine-patch blocks.  What did those squares want?  Color.  They were asking me for color.  I stuffed some money into my shorts pocket, grabbed my keys, and ran back to First Avenue to buy some bright blue fabric.   I did not know how to add more fabric to something that was already sewn together.  So I developed my own unorthodox method of after-the-fact appliqué.  Then I quilted the thing.  I bound the edges.  It was finished!  It was not perfect:  There were puckers.  Some of the corners didn't match up.  And there were those extra blue squares. But if you stood back and squinted, the quilt had a cheerful overall pattern, and it could cover a bed.  Right up until it wore out completely, I could look at that quilt and think with satisfaction, before I got my Big Idea, that didn't even exist!
	From then on, whenever confronted with a daunting task, I reminded myself that I had once made a whole quilt and lived to tell the tale.  And the quilt allowed me to experience the magic of art, that thing where your project starts telling you what to do, instead of the other way around.  
	Make something.  Get your supplies together, take a deep breath, and get to work.  Do you remember the Richard Dreyfuss character in Close Encounters of the Third Kind?  He had that mountain in his head, and it drove him to create it again and again.  He couldn't stop himself from making that thing.  Let your project do that to you; let it take you over and push you to the point where you surprise yourself.  Your project may not always be easy, predictable, or even cooperative.  But if you let your creation take you where it wants to go, it can transform you.

015527.txt,Mary,,50 - 65,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","August 22, 2006",2006,This I Believe,creativity,"I believe that the colorful displays of school supplies at the stores are like the sightings of the first bright orange-breasted robins in the spring.  School supplies are the harbingers of renewal and new beginnings.
     As a child, I always eagerly awaited the end of summer vacation to prepare for the start of a new school year.  I could only speak Greek when I started first grade in a Chicago public school, but not knowing English did not keep me from using my new shiny scissors to cut out shapes and my equally new brightly colored crayons to shade in the different designs.  I knew I could succeed, and I was just like my new English-speaking friend sitting next to me in school.  I repeated this happy and promising cycle of purchasing new school supplies for many years.
     As an urban high school French and English teacher for the past 30 years, I came to realize that purchasing school supplies, at the beginning of each school year, took on new dimensions.  As I inventoried what supplies I needed, I always asked myself, ""What will help to motivate my students?""
     My school supplies expanded from my usual purchases of bulletin board items, pens, pencils and folders to include some items not often thought of as staples for a successful school year.  One year, I purchased a large bright yellow rubber chicken; and, at the start of another school year, I bought a frog that squeaked and various monster finger puppets.  Another year, I added a small poster that simply said, ""This is a new day, with new beginnings and new dreams.""
     During the last ten years, my annual search for school supplies turned to specific items in bulk, items that manyof my students could not afford.  I looked for the best bargains I could find and purchased large quantities of pens, pencils, markers, folders and cough drops.  My most recent school purchases included a pair of school shoes, special shoes to run track events and even a portable sewing machine, to help some of my needy students achieve.
     This school year, I will not need to focus on the colorful displays of school supplies because I am now officially retired.  While I have not yet completely processed this change in my yearly life cycle, I am comforted by the thought that students and teachers throughout the world will continue to purchase school supplies and will carry on this ""rite of spring"".

016086.txt,Owen,,30 - 50,"Mountain View, Arkansas","September 8, 2006",2006,This I Believe,empathy & compassion;good & evil,"THIS I BELIEVE
I believe that we are all human; that's right, all of us.  And part of being human is that we all carry around inside of us the potential to do mean and stupid things that hurt other people.  I don't believe there is any way around this.  
A while back I was watching a movie with my children.  It was one of those big budget action/adventure spectaculars.  During the climactic fight scene between the good guy and the bad guy it occurred to me that this wasn't real.  I mean; sure we fight a lot, but this good guy/bad guy thing seemed to be a distortion of reality.  When looking back on the major conflicts that I've had in my life, whether they were with a boss, a spouse, or even the phone company, it seems to me that the other person was never all bad and I know that I was never all good.  Usually I need the perspective gained from a little history to see this, but I believe it to be true.
I know this is not a groundbreaking revelation. I believe there are times when we all get to this point of understanding and it is in these moments that, when faced with our own perpetual state of imperfection, we make choices that steer the course of our human relationships.  
When I realize that the hostility I have directed towards another was actually motivated by my own greed or fear or feeling of insecurity I have come to this place of decision.  Often my first impulse is to choose denial, to see myself as the constant 'good guy' who would do no wrong with malice of forethought.  Maybe this is instinct, the shielding of weakness.  But, I have learned that one of my greatest errors in judgment is to believe that others will think less of me if I acknowledge to them the mistakes I've made.  Sure it would be great to be right all the time, but who is?
When my children were little and I was stumbling along as an inexperienced parent there were times when I would unfairly lash out at them in anger and frustration.  Afterwards, I would usually make a habitual inward turn into self-recrimination.  But, one time I stopped myself and turned backed to my children and apologized, for them, because I wanted them to know that what I did was wrong.  And to my surprise, I saw my children grow up a little right before my eyes.  Instead of reproach, I could feel them sending me their love and support. 
To acknowledge one's own mistakes to another creates respect and trust, which helps us see each other as comrades in the struggles of life.  Whether we are children or adults, individuals or great nation states, to make a sincere and unguarded public apology is one of the most powerful acts of human relationship that we can make.

016203.txt,Alyson,,Under 18,"Haymarket, Virginia","September 12, 2006",2006,This I Believe,,"I believe that you need to have your eyes opened to see what actually goes on in this hectic world of ours.  
	Many people do not see half the hateful things that go on every day because they don't want to. I find the world I live in to be too hard to handle sometimes. You watch the news and a little girl is kidnapped, raped, and killed. For what reason, I believe the reason is because people don't grasp the concept that these events actually occur. You never think something that bad would happen to you, but the fact is that the people it happens to, have the same thoughts. People don't realize that in our world, there are a ton of people that do not care at all; things just don't make a difference. 
	About six months ago my eyes were opened to the cruelty in our world. I was going in to school late one morning and my mom had to stop at the post office. I sat in the car and applied my make-up while I was waiting for her to get back. Out of the corner of my eye I saw an old man using the side of the car as a sort of walking aid. I thought nothing of it except that he was a sweet old man and kept on applying my make-up. In the next instant the man disappeared, I looked down the hood of the car and all around me but couldn't see him anywhere! 
	I knew I didn't imagine it so I dropped what I was doing and got out of the car to see if I could find him. He was down on the floor because he had fallen. I helped him up and tried to keep him from falling again. The man could not walk on his own at that point and had told me that he just got out of the hospital. The first thing that crossed my mind was how this man got here, so I asked him. He told me that his daughter had picked him up from the hospital and drove him down to the post office. I asked him where she was now. He proceeded to tell me that she was across the parking lot in the car but she was too stubborn to help her dad because she thought he still belonged in the hospital.
	I could not believe the words that this man uttered out of his mouth. His own daughter was right there watching him fall to the floor because he could not walk. She just left him on his own because she was mad at him. The only thing that I could think was that she really did not care what happened to him. I knew there were people that didn't care, but I could never actually picture someone like that. This occurrence in my life opened my eyes to the world I actually live in.

016419.txt,Tillie Burkhardt,,,"St. Louis, Missouri",1950,1950,This I Believe,carpe diem;work,"I remember the day I first became aware of the simple fact that sometimes just a few wise words spoken at the right moment have a way of getting at the heart of life, of starting a person to think and to feel in a definite direction. That's the way it was with me.
Both my parents died when I was thirteen, and I found myself transplanted from open farm country to a crowded city. I was to live with my mother's sister and her family of five. That was that. The city closed in. I couldn't find the stars at night, I couldn't smell the dew in the morning. I couldn't talk to city people. Even God, who had always been near, was gone.
Then one evening as a neighbor started out to the tall building where she worked all night as a cleaning woman, she paused a moment on the steps where I was sitting, put her hand on my head, and said, ""Life ain't all you want, but it's all you've got. So stick a daisy in your hat and be happy."" Something happened. As I look at it now, it wasn't the thinking about what the woman said so much as a feeling it that moved me. The lift in her voice accepted challenge, not defeat.
I went indoors and got the one thing I had that might help push back the four walls made painfully evident each night by a glaring light bulb—a candle which had stood by my bed in the country. The walls disappeared. The next morning, I took what I had—a pair of strong hands, a strong back, a strong will—and got a job cooking and scrubbing floors.
Yes, a few words started me thinking and feeling in a definite direction. They made me see what I still believe after all this time—the present is more important than the past or the future. You must start where you are now with what you've got if life is to have meaning.
I mentioned this conviction first because the rest of my beliefs follow from it. They aren't very complicated. As a matter of fact, they've grown right where I've worked most of my life—in other people's kitchens. I believe that if a person decides—whether suddenly on a sun-filled morning, or painfully after personal tragedy—to start where he is with what he has, he will gradually discover he has certain gifts no one else quite has. A gift which, if used well, will have a way of helping other people, of bringing him to close to his fellow man and to God at the heart of all.
I don't mean he will ever have a step-by-step answer to life, that he will be protected from heartaches and trouble, but he will have a center to his being which will give much needed balance. I have learned this as I have worked. Somehow people like the bright warmth of a kitchen where there is always a pot of coffee on the stove, a fresh pie in the oven. They come in, they stop hurrying, they talk about life. It's funny; free as they are to become as individuals what they can and what they will, there is a oneness about their doubts, their question, their yearning. It's the way they go about trying to find answers that make them different again.
I've watched a lot of people through the years, done a lot of talking and listening, and I always seem to come back to the belief already expressed: those who grasshopper about after what they wish they were, chase wind. But those who use what they have and what they are, usually find themselves their place in the pattern and God. They are the ones who can stick daisies in their hats and be happy.

Burman wrote twenty-two books, including the bestselling Catfish Bend series about life in a fictitious Mississippi River town. Several of his books became movies, which included Steamboat Round the Bend, starring Will Rogers. Burman died from a stroke in 1984 at the age of eighty-eight.",50 - 65,"New York, New York","February 5, 2010",2010,Antidote for War,goodness & kindness;war,"I became a philosopher early. I had to become a philosopher. I was rather badly wounded in the First World War at Soissons, France, when I was twenty-two, and as a result, I was flat on my back for a long time. It was either get a philosophy, or crack up. My code of living is simple. It consists of three parts: 1) never be cruel; 2) always be artistic; 3) never lose your sense of humor.
Number one, I don't believe, requires much explanation. ""Never be cruel"" means, of course, always be kind. I believe that kindness is the natural human instinct, not cruelty. I have no illusions about humanity. I know its faults, its frequent blindness, its capacity for making terrible mistakes. But my work as a writer takes me among all kinds of men and women, often the very rough and the very poor. Everywhere, I have found generosity and nobility—men who would have gladly given their lives for me, because I had done them some slight kindness. The vast majority of human beings will do the basically good thing if they are given half a chance.
By the second point in my code, ""always be artistic,"" I mean that whatever I do, I try to do with as much grace as possible. If I write a book, I want to make it as beautiful as I can. If I were a shoemaker, I would want to make shoes the same way, as perfect as possible. In our madly commercialized and mechanized world, we have lost our sense of the beautiful. I believe we need beauty in our lives just as much as we need food on our dining room tables. A world where beauty flourishes is a happy world, a world at peace.
The third part of my code, as I said earlier, is ""never lose your sense of humor."" I don't like pomposity; I don't like stuffed shirts. I'm glad I was born in a small town. It's a wonderful antidote for smugness.
I remember years ago when I had a little success in New York with one of my first novels, there was the usual round of autograph parties and literary lunches, and I was feeling rather pleased with myself. About this time, I happened to go back to my hometown in Kentucky, and I saw an old fellow I'd known as a boy standing on the street corner. He looked me up and down a long time and remarked lazily, ""How are yah, Benny? You been away a while, ain't yah? Yah still teachin' school?"" That reduced life to its proper proportions.
I was over in Germany not long ago in the ruins of Berlin, and a reporter asked me to give his paper a thought for the day. That was a bit of an order for me, who had been in two wars against the Germans and had very definite physical souvenirs from both. I reflected on what I could tell the Germans under these circumstances, and then I wrote, ""When all the peoples of the world remember to laugh, particularly at themselves, there will be no more dictators and no more wars.""

016557.txt,Pat Frank,,,"Atlantic Beach, Florida",1950,1950,I Am Happy with My Time,war,"In 1945, I followed our armies in their final thrust through Italy, and then flew to Berlin to cover the Potsdam conference.  The American correspondents in Berlin were housed in the suburb of Zehlendorf.  I was billeted in a typical middle-class house on a shady street.  My roommate was Ed Murrow.  We were the only Americans in the house.
The Russians had occupied Zehlendorf before us, and they had stripped this house of linen and blankets, but we had our bedrolls.  The elderly couple that owned the house lived over the garage.  At first, these two old people were frightened of us.  They had been told the Americans were barbarians.  We would wreck their house and take what the Russians had overlooked.
We told the couple to come back and live in their own house.  And because Murrow and I had traveled long and far, we carried with us the staples that, in those days, correspondents did not overlook—chocolate, coffee, soap, tea, K-rations, and canned meat and butter.  We gave these things to the old people and told them to run the house, and take for themselves whatever they needed.  They were pitifully and almost incoherently grateful.  The next night, we found flowers in our room, and I knew we had made two friends.  In the ruin and bitterness of Berlin, still stinking of death, a vase of flowers was a wondrous thing.
I have seen and talked with the three enemy peoples of World War II—the Germans, the Japanese, and the Italians.  It has always been my belief that people everywhere are fundamentally alike, and I think that this is proved by the fact that these three peoples are now our allies, actual or potential.  It is fundamental that kindness will be repaid with kindness, and hate repaid with hate.
We live in what Toynbee, the great British historian, calls ""a time of troubles.""  But I am happy with my time.  Our generation has been bloodied by two wars, and perhaps faces a third, even more frightful.  But I would not have lived in another time, for there have been compensations, as small as flowers offered in friendship, and as inspiring as the birth of the United Nations.
If I live in a time of troubles, I also realize that I live in a time of great opportunity.  As a reporter and foreign correspondent, I was privileged to watch history being made, to see events which have helped to decide whether civilization shall stand or fall.  I have seen again and again how tremendously important the character of ordinary individuals could be in determining whether our children will live and whether they can be proud of our generation.  
I know that I cannot escape my responsibility to put the lessons I have learned into action.  With all my faults and frailties, I have a duty to myself and to the world I live in.  Perhaps I will never know just how important it is.  Yet, I must so live as never to be ashamed of how I fulfilled the duty.

I think it was Paul Elmer More, who wrote that, ""In this storm-tossed world in which we have to live, a man's ideas are his lifeline."" How true this has been of my ideals, for whenever I have clung to them with the hopeful desperation of a shipwrecked sailor, they have carried me to safety through raging winds and over angry waves. And I now realize that my lifeline always holds because its strands are everlasting, and because its two ends are securely fastened to the very rock of the eternal.
What I mean is that my eager search for the truth, my fervent love of beauty, and my reverence for goodness have, time and time again, superhumanly saved me from the recurring wish to die; from the devastations of sorrow; from the sharp pains and the dull aches of the body; from the dreary desolations of loneliness; from the humiliations of defeat; from the terrors of possible failure; from faithless despair; from bewitching temptations; from sloth; from moral indifference.
Time and time again, I have been lifted up, cleared out of a seemingly unendurable situation, either by the laborious and fascinating accumulation of data for the eventual verification or rejection of one of my conjectures, or by the sudden illumination lighted within my consciousness by a far reaching philosophical conclusion; or by the flames of beauty flashed upon my inner eyes by a sunset; or by one or two lines of poetry I glow with a heaven-lit fire; or by the sublime fragrance that emanates from the performance of a noble deed.
I do not know for certain what I live for. Only God knows that. But on the other hand, viewing my life in the long perspective of the years, I have learned from the indubitable certainty of life to rate that intimate experiences—that whatever fragments of truth, beauty, and goodness I have been able to reach—have fed and strengthened my soul, as milk, bread, and meat have periodically fed and strengthened my physical organism. And—because of what seems to be their supernatural energies—truth, beauty, and goodness repeatedly and mysteriously have sustained and carried me forward into a more abundant life, even in the midst of the most threatening conditions and unpromising circumstances.
Those, the three tightly twisted strands of my lifeline, have carried me safely through the storms, the strains and the stresses of a life that has now lasted nearly half a century in a world full of troubles and tribulations. For their tensile strength has no parallel in this integrating world of matter, their endurance is greater than that of the whole universe, and their two ends—believe me—are in the hands of God.

016677.txt,E.W. Jackson,,,"Austin, Texas",1950,1950,This I Believe,faith & religion;fear;purpose;responsibility,"I believe the most satisfying pursuit in life is in seeking perfection, trying to be like God as I conceive Him. My concepts of perfection grow. As I reach what once seemed distant goals, new and more fascinating ones come into view. So I shall never attain perfection and my satisfactions in seeking it will never end. Though the pursuit is unending, I can measure the distance I have come, but I cannot conceive the end: perfection. If I could, I should arrive and my satisfactions would be ended, since they lie in pursuit.
I believe God's laws operate in all realms of life. So in home, shop, store, school, or on the highway, I can pursue perfection just as really as when I worship formally. That is not to say that worship may be neglected. I believe that the earnestness of my search for perfection during my mortal life will have much to do with my immortal satisfactions.
I believe in prayer, not because I think I will be handed, as a gift, the things I might ask for. I think of prayer as a means of tuning in on the Supreme Intelligence. Effective prayer seeks only to place the supplicant in harmony with the divine. Gaining this harmony may bring spiritual and moral powers that under other conditions would seem miraculous. And speaking of miracles, I think they are regarded as miracles only to the extent that we do not understand God's laws. I think He does not violate His laws.
I believe that no worthwhile gain is made without sacrifice. Social gains usually cost dearly. Even so small a thing as a needed traffic light is usually not installed until someone has lost his life at the spot. I believe I should be willing to make personal sacrifices to improve my country. Such sacrifices may range from taking time to vote, to furnishing political leadership in a cause that will result in loss to myself, or even to giving my life. I believe willingness to sacrifice for unborn generations is evidence of the Divine Imprint on man.
Fear is the most blighting emotion that can affect my life. The more fully I trust the kindness and complete goodness of God, the less I fear. When there is no fear, it is easy to be kind and generous to neighbor and stranger alike. This complete trust does not lead to a fatalistic attitude. I have been given tools with which to work: hands, mind, body. So it is not for me to say, ""What is to be will be, and since God is good, all things will end well."" Rather, I should say, ""God is my Father. He has work to do, and I am His partner so I must help. With Him and His children working together, the ultimate will be good."" And finally, I must see the greatest opportunities to carry out my part of this partnership in my own family, the boy next door, in my own town and community. I must not let my concept of a partnership with God give me delusions of grandeur that will make me starry-eyed and ineffective.
These are my beliefs. I have difficulty living up to them, but they furnish me a satisfactory philosophy of life. Being reared in a fundamentalist religious home, I went through some groping periods in my early twenties that, measured by the beliefs of my parents, pointed to atheism. But that groping, plus years of living, has given me these beliefs.

016750.txt,Lucille P. Leonard,,,USA,1950,1950,This I Believe,brotherhood & friendship;charity & service;children;citizenship;democracy;education & knowledge;respect;social justice;values & spirituality,"I cannot speak of my beliefs without speaking of my father, who had such a big part in shaping them. Mother died when I was 3 year old, and upon Father fell the job of guiding me. Both my parents were teachers, and Father was a great believer in public education. To him, the school was the basis of democracy, the training ground for American citizens. Not that he talked about his belief in these terms. He was too busy living them and teaching them, and I strongly share his convictions.
My father was a natural leader in our community. People trusted him and turned to him. My room was next to his library, and as a child I heard him talk to people who came to him seeking counsel. I heard him settle questions [that] arose between members of the community, and I was impressed with the respect that he showed to all, no matter what their position in life.
But Father was not all things to all men. Once he had some difference with a neighbor. As a result, the neighbor never spoke to him again. But when the two men passed, Father always had a pleasant, ""good morning, good day."" This puzzled me. He never greets you. Why do you bother to talk to him? His reply was simple: ""He is a man, one of my fellow men, and I have nothing against him.""
Throughout my childhood I was encouraged to think for myself in all matters, including religion. I was taught to think and to think straight. To this day I try not to talk about something that I don't see clearly. I was taught to think about what is right and wrong, to believe in the old fashioned virtues: honesty, sincerity, reliability, justice.
At home I also learned not to choose the easier way when the harder way helped me prove my worth. When I ended Mount Holyoke, I drew up my own program of courses. I showed Father what I had chosen and he saw that I had leaned heavily on math. The subject came easily to me, as he well knew, since he had been my teacher. ""Lucille, why do you choose the easiest subjects?"" he asked. I knew what I had to do. I revised my program and took more history, which was not easy for me.
I found out very early too that nothing is to be gained by self-pity. If I took a job and found parts of it not to my liking, I knew I was expected to finish the entire task without feeling sorry for myself. I was taught not to duck and dodge but to give all that I had to any task I chose.
I have devoted my energies to the Parent Teacher Organization because I believe in its purpose: helping children, seeking for them the advantages that make for happy young years and healthy adulthood. The child has no voice. We grownups have to speak for him in the best way possible. The best way for me is through the Parent Teacher Organization, where I have the privilege of working for others, with others.
In that little New England community of my childhood, I learned to believe in the greatness and goodness of my country. I believe that my country's welfare depends on what I and every other citizen contribute to it. Citizenship to me is not something ever to be taken for granted. It is to be cherished, to be worked at. The world may have grown smaller since my childhood, but my country and its democratic ideals have grown larger in significance.

For his work to improve food service for combat troops in Korea, Mardikian was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award an American can receive.",,"San Francisco, California","August 21, 2009",2009,Why I Close My Restaurant,immigrant,"Every Christmas eve, I close my restaurant to the public.  My wife and I become the hired help to serve our employees.  We try to give them the finest Christmas repast.  This exchange of roles is symbolic.  This is an ancient Armenian custom we have introduced into our American life.
Each national group has brought something of its heritage in the form of thousands of different customs, which have become integral parts of life in this country.  I believe that true humility is a basic need of mankind today.  Why do I believe this?  Aside from the fact that Jesus Christ taught it, my own experiences seems to me a living testimony of its truth.
As a young man in my native Armenia, I was organizing boy scout troops when the Turks and the Russians invaded the Republic of Armenia.  I was captured and thrown into prison.  I nearly starved to death in this time of crisis.  An older and wiser inmate said to me, ""Don't lose hope.""  He was right, for some American friends in the Near East Relief helped me to escape.  They used the ruse of telling my captors that I was an American.  I became an American before I became an American.
Eventually, I was able to work my way to the United States.  Here I was, a humble immigrant boy crossing the Atlantic to a country that seemed to answer all my prayers for happiness and freedom.  My feelings when I first saw the Statue of Liberty cannot be described.  Even today, when I pass it on my frequent trips to Europe, a feeling—something like reverence—comes over me.
When I entered the shower baths at Ellis Island, I found plenty of soap and water.  I used them freely because it seemed to me that I was washing away all the hatreds and prejudices of the old world.  As I stepped out of the shower and came face to face with a guard in uniform, he actually smiled at me.  The smile of a stranger may seem to be a fleeting, insignificant moment to others, but I remember it vividly because it set the mood for my new life.  It was perhaps an omen of the joy and friendship I was to find about me.
When I first arrived, I spoke very little English and had practically no money.  But I did have enthusiasm, the will to work, and bright hopes for a new life ahead.  I got on the westbound train for San Francisco.  Everywhere I went strangers were willing to help, and I felt very humble.
This wonderful land has been good to me.  It has given me friends by the hundreds in all walks of life.  I believe that in this society where love and mutual respect are fostered and encouraged, I must do more than contribute my share towards the material and the spiritual well being of all.  I believe that friendship, which grows out of love and true humility, is the most important thing in life.

	I believe friends make a mark on your life that can never be matched. They are like finger prints, no two are ever the same. I believe being a true friend is the most important thing in my life.  Friends come first in my life, and I think it should always be like that. I believe I need to stand up for my friends when they have forgotten how.
	My best friend was beginning to loose herself to a boy last December. She was lost and didn't know what to do because of how much she liked him. She was being pushed to the limit everyday and was testing her emotions constantly. It had to come to a stop. I couldn't bare watching my friend fall apart to someone I knew was not a good person. I decided to take charge. I told this boy that he needed to be happy for what he had. I told him that being with her should be enough. She was the best thing that ever happened to him and she didn't deserve her. He realized that I was right and he needed to change.  He apologized with sincerity and learned a valuable lesson.
	I feel as if I need to put others before me because with out my friends how would I be happy? I think my friends deserve to be put first because how they  impact my life. They have effected and changed me so I think they deserve the best. If you treat your friend without care, they will become one of the crowd. If you treat your friend as they ought to be, they will become an individual.
	I truly believe I have to be the best friend I can be. It is what my friends deserve and what I expect of myself. I believe being a true friend can get you anywhere in life. I don't think you can have true friends with out knowing how to be one. My friends are truly amazing and I will always treasure their friendship.

As a four year old, I entered kindergarten   with a smiling face and all of my favorite books falling out of my backpack.  I read with my four-inch square glasses lying on the bridge of my consistently runny nose. My classmates would comment on my use of excessive tissues, or my constant drip. One girl in particular started commenting constantly regarding these ""boogeys."" I never knew what to say to her or to any of my classmates' mean comments. I would simply walk away. I wondered, from that moment on, what the right way was to use my voice.
In high school I came out of my shell. I learned not only how to stand up for myself, but how to use language as a powerful and positive force. Senior year, I was the president of my school's student-run debate and current events club. Since joining the organization my sophomore year, I have realized how people can use their voices for good, for communication, or for sharing personal beliefs. I would speak in front of 100 of my peers, whether it was announcing information about our seasonal conventions, or talking about serious issues of today, such as the legalization of gay marriage or how globalization is affecting individual cultures. As a group, we expressed our opinions in the local newspaper, broadcasting our opinions about online technology and privacy issues. Intelligent conversation and arguments allow for people to bond and share something powerful. We used our voices in one of the most important ways possible, as a tool of communication.
There are so many people in the world who would be penalized for using similar privileges, or for simply speaking out.  I hope to use the power of my voice to revolutionize policy for my country and to make the United States a better place to live. I am allowed to disagree with my government, a newspaper, or even my neighbor or a classmate.    Negative language is all over, but there are ways to respond to it, or ignore it when appropriate. I learned that violent words are never a solution to a problem. Still, some people are belligerent in their words and actions, but they do not achieve their goals and dreams. I don't shout, but I do let people know how I feel.  By using my voice as a tool, instead of a weapon, I hope to execute change.

017347.txt,Gretchen,,18 - 30,"Arlington, Virginia","September 20, 2006",2006,This I Believe,forgiveness,"This I Believe
	What if someone did a horrible and wrong thing to you, would you be able to forgive them?  I believe that every person has the ability to forgive, but some don't have the courage or will to do so.  The individuals that do overcome their differences and decide to forgive are, in my mind, the bigger person.  You have to keep in mind that people do make mistakes and just because this mistake might have influenced your life in a large way, it will benefit not only the person you are forgiving but also yourself because you have a clear conscience.  Is there really any benefit of not forgiving someone?  There really isn't because what would the world be like if everyone kept grudges, the world would have no beauty; rather it would be ugly and unpleasant.  Also, remember that forgiving someone is not on their behalf, it is an action in which you are freeing yourself from the situation and moving on with your life, not dwelling on it.  Just because you decide to forgive someone doesn't mean that you will forget.  Many things are forgivable but never forgettable.  As Thomas Szasz says ""The stupid neither forgive nor forget; the naïve forgive and forget; the wise forgive but do not forget"".  For the most part much of resentment towards a person is due to a large amount of hurt and pain.  Both hurt and pain will go away with time and then, and only then, will you sincerely be able to forgive someone.  Try not to get wrapped up in the situation and have every aspect of your life revolve around whether or not you will be able to forgive that certain person.  This just makes it even harder to forget what was done and to forgive.  
	One person who is very inspirational to me is Mahatma Gandhi.  His words are very true and meaningful.  He stated ""If we practice an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, soon the whole world will be blind and toothless"".  This is very true because if everyone acted out in revenge, what would we do to stop it?  There would be no end and a lot of people would end up getting hurt in the process instead of only a few people doing the painless act of forgiving.  Even though it may be hard, it is the best thing to do.  Gandhi also goes on to say ""The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong"".  This is very powerful and at the same time very true.  Many people think that because they forgive someone they are backing down or becoming the weaker man, but in reality that person had the courage to move on.  And that is really the key point; the stronger and more mature person is the one who forgives not the other way around.  Forgiveness, the act of separating one self from a difficult situation and coming to grips with reality and the fact that staying in a dispute will only worsen the circumstances; this I believe in.

     I believe in ending domestic violence. I have a friend that has gotten beat by her step dad. She is very scared of him because she doesn't know what to do. For every little thing her step dad or her mom will hit her. Her step dad even tired to touch her and her little sister. I think this isn't right and I hate what her mom and dad are doing to her. When she tired to tell her mom that her dad tired to touch her she didn't even believe her and she told me and I told her to tell the police, but she is scared that her dad might do something to her. She told me that if her dad tried to touch or hit her she would take her little sister and come to my house or to another friends house.
     She told her real dad and he believed her, but he can't do anything because he is in jail. She gets happy when she goes to visit her dad in Colorado because she gets to be away from her dad, but not from her mom so she is not that happy. Her mom hits her for nothing. When her mom is mad, for every little thing the girl does her mom hits her. What I told her is that when she gets hit to tell me and I don't want her parents to hit her anymore because I care for her and I know that she knows I do. Sometimes she invites me to her house and sometimes I say no because I am afraid of her dad that he will do something to me so I don't go. When it is her birthday I think I am the only one who gives her a present because her parents don't, they don't even buy her a cake and she gets sad and she gets happy when I give her a present. That is why I think that we should end domestic violence.
        That is what happened to my friend. She got beaten and her step dad tired to touch her. That is my story.This I believe.

I worry. And I don't mean that I care deeply about my life. I mean I worry about everything. From tests to piano practice, I worry. I'm good at it; I can make any situation into its very worst and convince myself that that is the reality of the situation. It's not a good thing, because I over-do it. I don't believe in worrying about anything that you know is inescapable. But I also believe it is possible to believe something so strongly, yet fail to follow it through. I will most likely always believe that worrying about the unavoidable is a waste of time, but I highly doubt that my stress level is going to go down significantly because of my belief.		
On the day before a test, I worry about anything I can think about. My notes for example; are they study-worthy? I worry about my study habits. If I study like this, will I make an 'A' tomorrow? Of course, I worry about the test itself. What if it's so long that I can't finish and fail the test? Though by the time that I have looked over my notes and reread the text, I realize that tomorrow can't possibly be that bad. It's twenty-four hours. What during the test could possibly happen that would completely ruin my life? What is it that is worth this much concern and aggravation? It's so frustrating, because I'm fully aware that I should not be worrying. I know it, but I can't stop. At least not at first. After about an hour or sometimes more, I calm back down. But it's a contradiction that I understand, I have to. It's the fact that I understand it that keeps me from going crazy.
How could we ever stop or prevent tomorrow? The question has been either wondered or asked by everyone. There is always a time when someone dreads tomorrow; when they'd rather be out of time and space for just twenty-four hours, and return the next day. Until this question finds its impossible answer, some people will always dread tomorrow, because tomorrow represents the unknown; the future we cannot tell.
 Time passes. Today's tomorrow will soon be today, and then yesterday. It all goes, and we are all powerless against it. Time is meant to change us, not the other way around, so whatever experiences it gives us, we take and learn. We cannot spend precious time worrying about another time ahead of us. We don't have time.

Most people never have to question this most fundamental and crucial belief, but to have it questioned is to have the ground cave beneath your feet and a gaping bottomless stygian hole open up.
I have a long history of depression, but havent felt the bite of it since I got on medication 3 years ago. After that I underwent surgery, and came out of it with seizures that lasted for the better part of a year. 
A neurologist and a psychiatrist that I first went to told me that I was ""addicted to unhappiness"" and that my mind was causing me to have seizures as it wanted me stay ill.
I felt like I was cleaved in two. I was absolutely certain that I wanted to get well and return to my post-medication stability, and yet the men with the degrees were telling me that my mind was acting on its own volition to reverse this.
My belief in what I felt in my innermost heart was shaken until I realised that to doubt my  belief in my mind was to hand over my sanity to someone else.
It was a very hard thought to hold on to, given the range of mental illnesses that are out there, and the weight of a professional's opinion.
But I decided to give my sanity the benefit of the doubt and sought out better, more experienced doctors in a bigger city. 
I am glad to say I was vindicated. It was proven that my seizures were a reaction to the spinal anaesthetic, something that is well-documented.
I shudder to think what would have transpired if I had not sought out more opinions. Even if I recovered, how would I live with the knowledge that my mind had duped me completely? Every thought after would be suspect. I would be living in a world of shadows with nothing at all to hold on to.
I came out of this experience with the realisation that for a number of people, this is their reality. My heart goes out to them.
I am only glad that I have a discerning and reliable mind that I can continue to believe in and that I plan to hold on to, literally, for dear life.

017760.txt,Matthew,,Under 18,"Lake Forest, Illinois","September 30, 2006",2006,This I Believe,social justice,"Breaking the News
All my life, my mom has strongly encouraged me to stay away from drugs and anything else that may harm my mind in any capacity.  Meanwhile, she spends her days in front of the television watching the national news.  ""But it keeps me informed,"" she claims.  I beg to differ.  I believe that the major news networks are corrupting both the minds and perspectives of their viewers.  To many people, the news is addicting.  Avid watchers can't wake up without, can't eat lunch without, and can't even fall asleep without hearing the latest most breaking news.  What do we seek in the news?  The news doesn't serve information; it serves depression in half-hour sessions.  The news is constantly placing trauma and despair in the minds of its viewers, and for this reason it is a depressant.  America's biggest drug fiasco, lay not in cocaine, or tobacco, or even caffeine, but in the news.  
	Every morning before school, my mother blesses me with a warm breakfast complete with a two-egg omelet, fresh fruit, and a tall glass of milk.  Sounds enjoyable right?  Well, as spoiled as it may seem, this is often the worst part of my day, because she insists upon watching CNN or MSNBC.  My first thoughts of the day are polluted with death tolls in Iraq, heart-breaking stories in the aftermath of Katrina, and word of new traces of mad-cow disease in America's beef (as I chew my sausage).  These stories never cease to sicken me, and while I should be starting my day off positive, more often than not, I begin in a state of near depression.  The stories are true, yet exaggerated because the journalists juxtapose the most outraging facts in order to create the most powerful story.  
	Even when the news is somewhat slow, the major networks sugar coat stories with eye-catching headlines such as ""Breaking News.""  Recently I stumbled across a headline which read ""BREAKING NEWS: N'Sync's Lance Bass is Gay.""  This is by no means breaking news, or surprising for that matter.  Furthermore, how can such a headline be shared between stories of meaningless celebrity gossip and important news such as terror alerts?  Plain and simple, the networks don't care about delivering groundbreaking stories, but rather getting the best ratings as possible.  Like a successful drug-dealer, the networks have two goals.  One: to attract the attention of potential customers, and two: to keep them coming back for more.  
	In 2005 the US forces were fully engaged in battle against Iraq, but what was on the minds of most Americans?  Who killed Lacy Peterson?  The news networks were devoting more time to Scott Peterson's new hair-do than they were to a newly formed democracy in Iraq.  This story is without a doubt tragic, but in the large scheme of things it is insignificant.  People are killed everyday, including those defending our freedom.  So what makes Lacy special?  She was attractive.  Have you ever seen a story about an unattractive girl being kidnapped?  No, but there seems to be an abundance of cute sixteen year old blonds getting abducted.  Networks don't pick the most imperative stories, but rather the ones that make them the most money.  The news is no longer the vital source of information that it once was, but merely a drug seeking to attract and addict as many viewers as possible.

017867.txt,Cameron,,Under 18,"Lagrange, Illinois","October 1, 2006",2006,This I Believe,work,"I believe that hard work builds character. Because of this, I do a lot of it. I have always been commended for my ""terrific"" work ethic. As I have gotten older, I have steadily started working more and more. By the time I reached my freshman year, I was essentially working a ten hour work day. Between school, homework, the 5 jobs I have, and the work that is required of me from living in my house, I would be working non stop almost ten hours a day. I would arrive at school at 7 in the morning, stay at school until 3 in the afternoon, and then go to work until 5. After that, I'd get home and start to chisel away at my massive piles of homework that was the result of signing up for honors English. On the weekends, I would work from 8 to 2 on Saturdays, and on Sunday I would do my homework and work on or clean cars.
Throughout my life, I have found that in almost every case, when kids are not taught what it means to work early on in life, they become lazy later on in life. Also, I find that their parents have trouble getting them to do what they are asked. For example, I spend my summers working for a family that lives down the lake from me. The father in this family has never asked his daughters to do anything, and now that they are in their teens, he can't get them to do anything. Thus, he hired me to do anything and everything that they won't. Unfortunately, these kids are extremely sheltered from what work is really like, which means that they won't end up doing as well in life as they would had they been taught some discipline by their parents.
	In my opinion, when you don't work hard enough, or discipline yourself, you are losing out on experiences that would help to shape you into an upstanding individual, who knows how to work hard when necessary.

This I believe…I believe in second chances.  I believe that we will all make decisions in which the consequences were not what we expected.  Negative consequences are often deserved, and although we have a small notion that they will occur, we are not always certain.  Humans are allotted a certain free will in which mistakes become inevitable.  With this free will we are also given the decision to forgive and allow others to prove themselves.  
Growing up I witnessed many mistakes.  These mistakes were made by both of my parents -the two people who were suppose to give me guidance and advice.  Yet, I was often looking at them and knowing that in order to be successful I would need to take a complete opposite path.  My parents are both amazing people, but it has taken second chances and even third chances for me to see that quality.
My mother and father married very young as the result of my mother's pregnancy with my oldest sister.  They then had two more children, me being the third.  They fought almost everyday, in fact those are the only memories I can even recollect from their marriage.  Having children was supposed to bring them closer, instead with each child their relationship worsened.   At the end of their marriage they were both having affairs.  My mother's resulted in the creation of my half sister, and my father's gave me a new stepmother.  I was only six when all of this began unraveling, so forgiveness was easy to find. I know the saying ""time heals all things"", but my family required a lot of time.  
My mother's new boyfriend (the father of my half sister), quickly entered our lives.  He moved in almost immediately as my father moved out.  He had, and still has, a serious drug and alcohol problem.  He charmed my mom when he was sober, and beat her when he was under the influence.  He did not work or make any contributions to our family.  My mother gave him chance after chance until the day he went to prison.
My father quickly moved in with his mistress.  He began a new life that did not include his children.  I know that he has always loved us, and will always love us, but love is a hard emotion for my father to share.  He did not realize the importance of phone calls and letters.  He always knew the importance of work and promotions, yet disregarded child support as an important part of his life.  After many years of living in poverty I began to hate my father.  
I was unable to forgive my parents for a long time.  For many years I did not know that I was even blaming them for my unhappiness.  My parents began to make a lot of positive changes in their lives.  My father calls me now, and my mother is making positive, beneficial decisions everyday.  My parents have given their friendship a second chance, and now communicate with each other.  No family is perfect, especially ours, but we are trying now to learn from the past and give each other as many chances as we need.  
We have survived these crises and have all proved ourselves to be better, stronger people.  I never hesitate to give chances now that I am older.  There is no one is this world that I hate.  In order to receive forgiveness you must also give.  There are mistakes, or what some of us call sins, that are so terrible and unfathomable that it is hard for us to ever imagine finding peace.  I have dealt with this and realized that without second chances we are all doomed.  Not only am I able to forgive, but most importantly I am able to look at people with an open mind that is not judgmental of their past.

In high school, I never wore jeans and a cute shirt. Instead I always wore comfortable pants, a t-shirt, and a sweatshirt, unless I had a track meet then I wore a skirt, so no one could see the real me, I always wore my hair up and of course no make up at all because I was afraid of what people might think of me. I always looked at the skinny girls with all of the boyfriends and thought ""God, why can't I be like that?"" My self-esteem wasn't so high. I would always have my grandma telling me that I was too big and she would tell me I look bad and even my parents would say ""Are you gaining weight?"" So I started believing all of those things and then I started beating myself up for being ""ugly"". My friends would always say ""no, you're not"", or ""cut it out,"" but I kept doing it so much that they didn't really want to be around me. 
I did that until I met Doug (my ex-boyfriend now). He was the one that showed me how to love myself. Once I found out that he loved me for me and for what was on the inside, the outside didn't matter anymore. I started accepting myself for who I was and I started showing the real me. 
Doug was a good thing that happened to me; he showed me not to care about what other people think. I guess things didn't work out between us because we started drifting apart. You know how people say that things happen for a reason? Well, I think that Doug was brought to me so the real me would come out of my shell and be released to the whole world.
 So this is for Doug for believing in me and giving me the confidence to love myself.  Now others can love me for me and for what God made me today. For this I believe that you should love yourself, and then others will love you as well.

Respect and trust is usually not associated with someone trying to knock another down or diving at someone's heels. But something changes when eleven people work together to push themselves to the limit on the football field. 
	I believe that football teaches respect, trust, and determination to those who truly experience its effect.
	When I was in grade school I idolized football players. I envied all the glory that came with their title. I couldn't wait until high school so I could be a football hero like the players on TV. My freshmen year of football I didn't know what it felt like to lose. My team went undefeated in a 9-0 season. To me, my team was untouchable, undefeatable. My overconfident attitude made it all the harder to lose our first game ever early in the sophomore year. My sophomore football coach could be described as a pusher; he not only pushed me to my physical limits but forced me to reexamine my own reasons for playing football. My coach taught us to have respect for ourselves, our teammates, and our opponents. He taught us how to handle victory and deal with loss. Most importantly he taught us to trust ourselves and our teammates on the field. 
	Would I have learned these lessons without playing football? I doubt I would be standing here half the man I am now without playing the game that's taken me so far. I would not have the determination, the drive, or the heart I have today. After four years of high school football, most of my teammates and I will never play football again. Most of us will never lace up our cleats, strap on our shoulder pads, or take a hit for the team again. That sounds disheartening or depressing, but to me that sounds just about right. Though I love football, I know it must come to an end for me some day. And I believe that if you truly experience football, four years is enough to learn the lessons it can teach.

Everything I want to do with my life depends on these damned pieces of green paper. I feel like all I am doing is throwing it around to pave my path to my grave. Thanks to money, a black hole is surfacing in my life and getting rid of the one thing I live for: Happiness.
	Somehow I'll over come this habit. I'm talking to my family, my friends, and my psychologist for help. I know my problems aren't as bad. I have a friend, who is on food stamps, but he still comes to school with energy and a smile, you'd never expect anything to be wrong with him. I admire him for it. Who knows, maybe I'll turn to him for some insight.
	Only change will kill the catalyst money is, fortunately I do not fear change.

    Growing up, my father and I used to travel all over the world. We'd stand and watch the sun set past midnight on the edge of the Gobi desert. Or we'd be watching sunsets outside our huts in the Philippines. But wherever my father and I went, we shared experiences people can only dream of.
    Then there's people in the United States, those who continuously question the meaning of their lives. Those who are not able to function, due to their own depression. The meaning of life. Their purpose. Once they figure this out, they fill their lives in with futile acts because every spare minute is a minute wasted. They thrive on their talents until they are successful. Then they reach midlife crisis, then ask themselves the meaning or purpose of their lives all over again.
    I believe that there is no universal meaning of life. I believe we give our own lives their own meanings because the actions we choose to take, depending on the decisions presented to us, are what shape who we are. Thus, I am glad that my father (no matter how much I detested traveling as a kid) took me to over 26 countries and eventually forced me to learn five languages fluently. I am grateful that he forced me to read difficult books when I was young, just so I could advance further and faster than others in the future.
    I believe that it is not important to know the meaning of our lives. In the end, the only question I will ask myself is whether I lived my life to the fullest. And that does not mean, 'Have I filled up every second of my life with something important to do?' Am I content with the way I lived my life? And if I can answer, 'Yes', then I will die content.
    The balance between success and happiness is a hard one. But sacrificing such a balance in its entirety is a novice's mistake. Sure, all happiness can lead to a great life, but without any success, how far will life take you? And, of course, all work and no play can make anyone unhappy. So where does one draw the line? As he sees fit. But a healthy balance between work and play always works out best.

The chances are real close to nine hundred ninety-nine out of a thousand that ""The Bribe"" will be an element of someone's nefararios plot, but that does not concern me. I believe that once you accept the terms of ""The Bribe"", you must stay bribed until the briber releases you from your bond. It behooves both parties to understanding the potentially long time frame that could accompany such an agreement. The level of secrecy has to be established. Everyone involved must remember the potential adverse side-effects presented by bearcats thus far not named. These are but a couple of the elements that go into determining ample consideration. Herein; ""Jack"" broke the law, he spoke about the existence of ""The Bribe"". Breach of The Code of Conduct for the Bribee usually results in jail, a refund, death, or combination of the above. At what point does the bribe actually become a bribe? What do you call the briber before the bribe? What do you call the bribee before the bribe? The bribe comes to life when half the agreed consideration is transferred too or deferred from party ""A"" to party ""B"". They are both just people living their lives not trying to be defined by one event. Image this coming from me, ""Hershall"", he who was at one time reputed to be a retail distributor for an anonymous underground pharmaceutical firm. Sadly; no past or present Grand Jury has returned a writ, and I have been deprived the opportunity to defend or defy such character distorting attributes. I quest it would be understandable for someone as close to the edge as my life has been to believe in ""The Bribe"". Truly the relationship between the Briber and the Bribee – last  a  long  time. Being an American, I was brought up to believe in ""The Bribe"". That's why you would never, I repeat never attempt any of the following: never attempt to offer fifty cent to a valet to park your Jag. Never attempt to offer the paperboy $2 at Christmas. Never attempt to offer a congressman $99,995. Never attempt to offer a waitress a quarter tip (To Insure Proper Service) before you get your meal. Never attempt to offer Michael a girl, you heard what he said about 'Billie jean'. ""Katherine Harris"": now I've said it. We're even. No you can't ride on my plane.

Most parents do not survive knowing that their child has cancer, mine did.  My oldest sister died of neuroblastoma.  My other sister had her kidney removed when she was only three and somehow my parents managed to stay together.
I've often heard that losing a child will make you stronger or will ruin a relationship and destroy you.  In the case of my parents, I think it made them stronger.  I believe that during the tough times family makes all the difference.
My family has been touched a lot by cancer.  My dad is an only child; however he and his cousin, Big Ken, grew up like brothers on their farm in West Virginia.  When Big Ken was dying of esophageal cancer, he was unable to go upstairs.  He had a hospital bed in his living room.  I went to visit him and although I do not recall exactly what he said to me, I remember the room and still can picture it today.  It was hard to say goodbye, but even harder to comfort my cousin Sadie after her father died.  I wasn't sure what to say, only that I would always be there for her.
A few weeks ago my dad was diagnosed with cancer, just like Big Ken.  I was scared at first when my mom told me, but I know he will be okay.  My parents are brave and I don't know how they do it.  
I don't know how my dad's cancer is going to affect my life.  Last week, my brother was coming over and my parents were cooking us dinner.  I was making plans to go shopping for a homecoming dress.  I asked my mom if we could go that weekend.  She could not give me a definite answer because she wasn't sure if they would be out of town seeing doctors.  My dad was cooking a turkey.  He got really mad when the oven stopped working.  He just threw the oven out.  I think he was annoyed with everything going on his life and all the decisions he had to make.  I went outside to help him.  On the way to the garbage, my dad turned to be and said, ""I'm sorry I'm screwing up your life.""  All I could do was say, ""Dad, you're not"" and I gave him a hug.
It's hard not knowing what will happen.  All I know is that I to support my dad in anyway I can.  Whether it be accepting that I can't make plans or just getting him wheatgrass smoothies, I will be there for him.  It is hard not knowing if or how my dad's cancer will affect my life, but I have found that it is easier to just keep busy.  
I believe that it is important for family to stick together and support each other through hard times.  I believe that my family will make it through once again.

Although people may say that America stands for individualism, when I look around, it's hard to find it.  Everyday when I walk into school, I see people standing in groups.  On the left there are the preps, and over to the right, those are the emo kids, and so on and so forth.  It's awful that so many people are categorized by what clothes they wear or how much money they have.  This form of judgment doesn't just happen in schools, it happens everywhere.  
	Every morning I wake up at 6:45 to get ready for school.  After I get out of the shower, do my hair, and put on my make-up, I step into my closed and spend what seems like forever trying to pick out an outfit.  It's horrible that I have fallen into the mindset of conformity, but in high school, it's hard to think anything different.  I have become so worried about what others think of me that I have forced myself to conform. 
	At school, a person who is an individual is often made fun of or picked on.  It pains me to say this, but I have found myself talking negatively about the way others dress.  The truth is I am jealous of how comfortable they are with their individuality and how they don't care about what other people think of them.  Why do people care so much about what other's thin?  When did it become okay for one person to judge another person?
	I live in a city where there are a lot of wealthy families.  Since most of the kids at my school come from those wealthy families, they often judge people on how much money they have.  Everything is very materialistic, and I continuously feel like I fall into that trap.  Everything always has to be ""the best,"" but it always seems like nothing's good enough.  Some of the students at school are so concerned about their appearances and their reputations that they lose focus on what's really important, like they're school work.  
	Even by watching a TV show or a movie, I can see that our society has become too obsessed with image and conformity.  I believe that people need to resist conformity.  No one should be afraid to express themselves.  Whether a person expresses themselves through their clothes, artwork, writing, etc. it's their choice. This is what I believe.

019508.txt,Christina,,30 - 50,"Oshkosh, Wisconsin","November 6, 2006",2006,This I Believe,death;pets & animals;respect,"Some months after Hurricane Katrina, my sister-in-law & I were discussing the clips of animal rescues:  the man who hid his snakes in his jacket to evacuate on a chartered bus; the man & dog who swam out together, both matted with oil slick & refuse; animals left behind, and families frantic to find them. Why, she & I both wondered, was it those stories that pulled our heartstrings?  Perhaps there was something fundamentally wrong with our empathetic faculties.
For me, the moment came while watching a clip of a man dragging a big green Rubbermaid behind him, as he slogged through god-knows-what to safety.  In the Rubbermaid huddled a very scraggly dog of indeterminate breed, and a tabby cat, petrified & damp. I just started sobbing –as if my levees were breaking.  After the media saturation of families abandoned, corpses floating face-down, and homes left no more than sieves of stud walls & sashes, it was this man, with his unlikely cargo that broke me down.  I believe that animals are proxies for our most vulnerable selves.
Last spring, my partner & I took in a rescued Cane Corso named Bella.  We learned bits & pieces of her past: owners who weren't prepared for her needs, her handing off to numerous homes, her isolation and neglect.  Among her previous owners was a heroin addict who overdosed; her body was discovered days later, tended to by her loyal dog.  We walked her & loved her; set up a regular schedule of exercise & food; consistently established rules & discipline. But Bella wasn't thriving.  She was dying.  Each week we went to the vet, tried various tests, special diets, radiogrammed for obstructions, collected stool samples like precious gems.  She was losing an average of five pounds a week.  Her ribs crisscrossed her brindle stripes like some sort of macabre map.  When we'd submitted the last blood sample, and were waiting for the last possible result, we made the decision.  She was barely 70 pounds; and tired out from circling the short city block.  It was time to euthanize.
Oddly enough, I thought of my grandmother who died last fall.  She'd been diagnosed with acute leukemia, & refused treatment.  On her last two days, she was mostly unconscious.  Her death-rattle vibrated the house from the rafters to the basement.  All we could give her was morphine & wait.  I hope that morphine knocked her out –made the world a grey expanse of nothing.  I hope it hastened her end; she wanted it to.
I believe the greatest responsibility we have to each other is to recognize the inherent dignity of life.  That means also recognizing the dignity of death.  Our dog, Bella, couldn't make that decision.  As her owners, we had to.  
There is good news here.  That last test result yielded an answer.  Bella is still with us, topping out at 100 pounds, healthy enough to chase rabbits until nightfall, and dream about them until morning, sharing the bed with us, & the cat.  And my grandmother had a good life.  And she died, as she wished, at her daughter's home, surrounded by family that loved her –that perfectly-imagined hospice death.  And despite all the stories of cruelty & neglect during the aftermath of Katrina, we have those images of people protecting the innocents, cradling their pets, and their own fears & memories of vulnerability; protecting their manifest selves come hell and high water.

019528.txt,Kao,,18 - 30,Massachusetts,"November 7, 2006",2006,This I Believe,setbacks,"We heard stories about a thin man in dark Hmong clothes, rags held together by big safety pins, walking in flip-flops about the dirt roads of the village. A poor man who was silently insane. He climbed roofs and took asunder pieces of trees.
In 1978, his brothers left him in the jungle of Laos. There was a massacre of the Hmong.  Uncle Shong's son was on his back. The bullet hit the little boy in the head. Blood soaked into his father's shoulders. My Uncle made a decision to stop running. He stopped his tired feet. He pulled his child in his arms. He said goodbye to his brothers, their ragtag groups of hungry children. 
Uncle Shong sent tapes to the camps of Thailand looking for his brothers. In a small voice that shook at the ends, he told the story of how he was captured, taken into an enemy village, placed on a bamboo platform in the middle of an empty hut. Syringes of hot liquid were inserted into his arms. Questions: Where are your brothers? Where have they gone? Why are you here? 
The voices filtered through a growing haze. After a month of relentless questions, hot liquid heating his blood, he was released. The man who had walked on steady feet, faltered on shaky legs. Uncle Shong would never be the same man again. 
Uncle Shong who had taught my father how to be a man.
When the rooster crowed in the early morning and my father turned against the coming day, Uncle Shong said, ""The body works in the world, it tires. Call always on the heart first.""
When my father rolled a boulder down a hill and it fell on the neighbor's fence the man came over and knocked on their door. The adults told my father to go and fix the broken fence. My father cowered in their anger, his unthinking action, unsure of how to fix what was broken, how to repair the work of grown men. Uncle Shong kneeled close and told my father he would fix the fence. He assured my father that there was hope for little boys to grow up to be good men.
When my father fell in love with my mother in the war and everyone said it was no time for marriage, Uncle Shong went with my father to ask for my mother's hand. He believed fervently that love happens before life. 
In 1978 his brothers left him. In 2003, an ocean, years and year away, he left them. He left them with a legacy of his heart, his unending care. They cried for him in their homes. Searched for him in their memories. Remembered his words and his stories. They taught their children to believe in a man who was small, whose life was full of sorrow, but whose good heart remained intact through the worst of what human beings can do to each other, in love and in war.

019714.txt,Tommy,,18 - 30,"Dunn, North Carolina","November 11, 2006",2006,This I Believe,equality,"Equality and The American Dream
	I believe in the idea of equality.  Notice that I believe in the idea of equality, not the actual thing.  This isn't because actual equality isn't worth believing in, but simply because it doesn't really exist.  It is perhaps the cornerstone belief that the ""American Dream"" concept is built on, that every person is equal regardless of their background.  This idea, while simple in its makeup is far more complex when practiced in reality.  The reality is that everyone is not viewed equally in today's society, with all it's bias.  Almost anything can influence how you are perceived in the world.  Are you rich or poor?  Are you educated or not?  These adjectives that describe us also define us in a deeper way than we would probably care for.  When any one of us applies for a job, inquires about a rental apartment, or tries to get a line of credit we are immediately subjected to the kind of bias that is reducing the reality of equality to a simple idea.  Let me explain.  As soon as you apply for that rental property, the agent might asses you based on what she immediately sees.  Are you of an ethnicity that would ""mesh"" well with the community in which you want to live?  Perhaps that person might have a stereotype in their head about the ""kind"" of person you are, based on your race or educational level.  Or perhaps you want to get that mortgage from the bank to buy your first house.  In the world where everyone is equal, anyone should have a fair chance at that loan.  The fact is, however, that the job you hold will have an impact on the outcome of the bank's decision.  For instance, if you are a sales rep. for a big sales firm and you make $40,000 a year, you might get a loan that a teacher with the same salary wouldn't get based on your potential future earnings of the job you hold.  I ask, is that fair?  Is that equality?  Will it ever change?  While the answers to theses questions elude me at this time, I do hope that others will join me in my belief of the idea of equality, and in doing so might help bring this simple idea into the real world.  Maybe then the ""American Dream"" can become the ""American Reality.""

019876.txt,Kiara,,Under 18,"Austin, Texas","November 14, 2006",2006,This I Believe,goodness & kindness,"A good hug is 100% joy + human connection + love = awesomeness. I don't take for granted a hug's awkwardness; I let the process become familiar, because after the oafish grappling of arms and pressing of bodies there is a moment that I have repeatedly fallen in love with. It's like this omnipotent clarification, this ultimatum of understanding that, ""Wow. Everything is going to be okay."" The value of a hug is remarkable, and I believe in appreciating the value of a hug. I first discovered this moment on a particularly bad day involving a 69 in French III and a lost cell phone. I was down, depressed, and desperately seeking human connection. All of my prayers were answered in the form of a hug.
 My junior year of high school I was really good friends with this amazing girl named Melissa. We had Theatre together after lunch, and so usually that was the first time we saw each other every day. For months we carried on the same routine. When we saw each other for the first time we would hug, every single day. 
Everybody has their bad days, mine mostly involved failing grades, stupid hurtful people, and unusually bad coincidences. When those days came around, probably a Monday, I would be ready to sling my backpack off my shoulders and hold on to her for dear life. And she had her problems too, divorced parents, a sister off in college, and Algebra II. I always knew when she was having a bad day because she would be waiting for my entrance. It didn't matter if I was in a grumpy mood, I would open my arms and allow her head to rest on my shoulder just like always. Hugs just happen, you shouldn't have to question or think about a hug. 
The good days, however, were the most rewarding. Of course life seemed to shine a little bit brighter with a 99 in AP History or a role in the next show. When it's a good day a hug is more about the giving. For a brief moment you're allowed to share the happiness with another person. I'm telling you, a quality hug is like snow on Christmas morning. It's perfection to find the comfort in another's embrace so warm and genuine that your problems are put on hold. 
	I learned so much about Melissa that year and 90% of the information was gained through a daily hug.  A hug is an immediate and deeply personal connection with another person. It allows you to give and take effortlessly and is completely dependent upon both participants. A hug can be a way to say thanks, or I love you, or good job, or hello. To me a hug is like whispering just loud enough to barely hear, ""This is how I feel."" I believe in appreciating the value of a hug becau

Don't hold back, don't waste another second, don't let life slip away and have no fear. These are the words that I live by, especially when I am on my skateboard.
I put a lot of time, money and determination towards my passion of skateboarding. If you want to progress as a skateboarder, you have to take risks, practice daily, and step out of your comfort zone. Once you step past the fear of falling, anything is possible. If you are scared about doing a certain trick and only go half in, then an accident is bound to occur, it's all or nothing. Even if you give it your all, there is always the chance that you could fall, but you must persevere, get up, and try again.
Just six months ago I fell skating and shattered both bones in my left arm. I was at a local skate spot with two of my friends. I was on top of a large cement platform and I was jumping from the platform fridge that was on its side. There were large pieces of concrete boulders inside to weigh it down. I had successfully landed this trick several other times that day. My friends wanted to leave, but I told them that I wanted to try it one last time. On my final attempt I didn't land completely parallel with the fridge and my board slid out from under me. I don't remember how I fell, but I think I flipped over my side and my arm swung outwards and smacked one of the concrete blocks. The next thing that I remember was getting up and looking at my arm, I knew right away that it was broken. I suppose that I was in a state of shock with adrenaline flowing through my body, because I felt no initial pain. I told my friends that I broke my arm but they didn't believe me. They thought it was some kind of joke. While one of them got my board and iPod, I quickly pulled off my shirt and wrapped it around my arm. My other friend then reached into my pocket and grabbed my car keys. 
The after math of this incident was two plates and sixteen screws to hold the bones in my left arm together. I persevered, got up, and one week after surgery is was back on my board. I love skateboarding too much to just give up. Since then, my outlook on skateboarding hasn't changed. To this day I still skateboard and live life to the fullest.

020151.txt,Anthony,,Under 18,"Centennial, Colorado","November 19, 2006",2006,This I Believe,science,"I believe in science, but more importantly I believe in the fact that science can find the truth in things.  Before the Earth was round, it was flat.  Before we revolved around the sun, it revolved around us.  Before with evolved, we were created in the blink of an eye.  These beliefs were accepted as fact and unquestioned until some of the greatest minds we had, found problems within them, and tried to discover the truth.  All the time, theories and ideas are being rejected or accepted as fact based on scientific knowledge.  We rely on it to determine right from wrong and fact from fiction.  Science is a method that has proven itself time and time again.  If we look back across history we see how science has proved itself over and over again as a great method for solving the mysteries of life. Ultimately, science has shown its ability to express the truth. The scientific method allows scientists to test a belief and find whether it is correct, or totally wrong.  They use solid concrete laws of nature to prove or disprove their theories. 
Science has no internal motive besides personal gain.  This ultimately means that science has a great chance of finding facts with the sole purpose of heightening education.  Science is also re-creatable.  Science provides an opportunity to test ideas repeatedly in different situations.  We have re-created primitive cells born form the primordial stew, and recreated instances that occurred thousands of years ago.  Finally, science has the ability to evolve and adapt with the times and evidence.  Theories are always changing because nothing in the scientific world is set in stone besides the natural laws the govern everything.  In the early stages evolutionary theories, things changed rapidly as more theories were produced.  Science can effectively evolve because with factual evidence and logical reasoning, theories can develop based on other ideas.  The scientific community makes room for people to expose their ideas and have them critiqued.  
	It is time that we put our faith in science.  Where would we be without it?  I look and see this concept that has proved it self to be the best method of truth for exactly what it is: The best source of knowledge.  I see it like this, because I believe in science.

I believe one can never underestimate the power that children have in changing people and making our world a better place in which to live.
When I was a teenager I had no idea what was going on in my neighborhood much less my community or the world. After I finished high school, I wanted to just hang out for the summer. Instead, I was asked to work at a camp for kids as a counselor because they were short of staff. I, being of sound body and cool mind thought I could go hang out in the woods and commune with nature, not once thinking about the little seven year old girls for whom I would become mom for a week. Not having much experience in taking care of children, I had a lot to learn. 
We spent the week hiking in the woods, making rafts to float down the stream, helping plant pine trees as a service project, and singing everywhere we went. I felt like the pied piper! By the time the traditional closing ceremony and campfire came along at the end of the week, the little girls had ratty hair, smudges on their faces, and a whole suitcase full of clean clothes still packed underneath their macaroni shell necklaces. They looked like refugees from a relocation camp, quite proud that the only bath they received during the whole week was a daily dip in the pool. 
As the youngest counselor with the youngest kids in camp, I was asked first to step forward near the fire and award tokens to the girls in my group. I need to say here that I am not a very creative person in the area of arts and crafts and as a last resort, had picked up a handful of rocks and painted them gold. As I stood there in the warm night next to the fire with my little girls in tow, I can only say that magic was in the air. Those little girls looked up at me with smiles beaming across their faces. I was so proud of them and they were so proud of themselves, the trees they had planted and their ability to live in a cabin away from mom and dad for a whole week. You would have thought that I had given them ten dollar gift cards to the Mc Donald's, they were so happy. I could see that they felt proud for receiving a token for their efforts. They clung to my shorts all night wanting to be near the person that had helped them make it through the week. 
But the truth is that those seven little girls are the ones who changed me. I had no confidence in my abilities to do anything. I was a slacker in high school and had no idea what I was going to do with my life. They gave me the confidence I needed to go out into the world and face it head on. I went back to that camp for seven years and went on to work in the field of youth development where I could help other youth gain confidence and life skills. It is through these experiences that I have come to believe what I believe. Over the past 25 plus years, I have had the privilege of working with youth from many communities. It is through their eyes that I see not only our community but the world. These youth have given me hope for our future. 
Despite what you hear daily on the news about teens and drugs and violence, millions of today's youth are smart, caring people who offer a tenacious hope for a brighter, better future. Furthermore, they are eager to learn the skills that will help them change this world into their world. 
Luckily their world will be my world too, and I am thankful that they will be able to create the very future that we all wish to see!  
What I believe is that our children and teens are a source, and a force, of infinite good.

I'm weakened by anti-intellectualism. I'm frightened that children are taught not to think. I find pop-culture a tool of positive change rather than a tool of oppression. Because something is popular does not create its seemingly inherent corruption – it is after all, the culmination of our human nature. 
I believe that government is a place for people to come together – better than a supermarket or a country club – we must come together as a society in some form and because government protects us in a way more equal than any other – I choose it. I believe however, that it must be protected. 
Democracies need gardeners – and I have all the time in the world to get dirt on my knees. 
I love cameras – I love cell phones. I'm a technology junkie because I see technology as an expression and amplification of our humanity – not a dulling of our sociality, but an enhancement of our social strengths. I love the internet. I think communications technology will be the single most important factor in creating a more peaceful, equal and just world.
When I'm on the freeway – I get a sense of 'we are all in this together' rather then an angry frustration with those around me causing the traffic. The other day I heard some people say ""What will they think of next?!""
I realized – that statement is the antithesis of the way I approach the world. For me, it's: ""What will we think of next.""
I'm firmly hopeful, it's in my nature.

When I say that I teach high school English at an alternative school, those are the comments people make. Yes, many of our students have rap sheets and discipline records that make you cringe. Does this mean they aren't worthy of an education? Aren't worthy of being treated with respect and human dignity? Many say yes, but I disagree.
I believe that you have to do what is right no matter what others think.
People often ask me why I teach at an alternative school. Can't you get a job at a real school? I believe that I am where I am meant to be. I know what it is like to make mistakes. I know what it is like to feel like no one understands, and not to care if anyone understands. I also know that I am true to myself regardless.
He came in that day with a hard, cold stare…like looking at walking death. He sat down in a back desk and put his head down. Now, some would say I should have sent him to the principal, but I had to follow my heart. Be true to myself. I sat down beside his desk quietly asking him what was wrong. He never lifted his head off his arms, but he told me his story. He was going to court the next day for possession with intent to distribute. ""I'm gonna get locked up,"" was all he said. I don't remember all I said, but I tried to be encouraging without preaching. He left the room and I didn't expect to see him again.
The next day, my principal said I had a visitor. There he was standing at my classroom door. He came to tell me that he was sentenced to 90 days. He wanted me to know. He wanted to tell me goodbye. I didn't see a convicted drug dealer. I saw a young man who believed I cared. And I did. After he left and my class went to lunch, I shut the door of my classroom and cried. I cried for who he is and who he could become.
Some people said that I was wrong – that he was a thug, a gang member, a drug dealer. Yes, he is all of that. He is also a person. I believe I have to do what is right, no matter what others think. In the end, it's between God and I…everyone else is just tinkling cymbals.

	I first encountered foot binding in Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth and later, in more detail, in Snow Flower and the Secret Fan by Lisa See.  I looked down at my own size ten feet after reading about the long, painful, bone-breaking process of making feet smaller.  My feet are twenty-four centimeters, more than three times the ideal size.  I could picture my prospects in old Chinese society sinking, because of the awful trait of big feet.  That was not the worst that could happen though: I read that ten percent of girls died from foot binding.  My feet felt uncomfortable at just the thought of foot binding, and I was sure that I would have been in the ten percent that died.
	I get my feet from my dad, who wears size fourteen shoes.  We both even have toes that hide behind the middle toe.  From the time I was a baby, my feet have been big.  When I was born, doctors took a foot print from me.  My foot print bled over the allotted space and into the text above it. I have always been fond of my feet. I was surprised to find in China, a little more than a hundred years ago, my foot size could have determined my whole life.
	I had first encountered an emphasis on small feet when I saw Disney's Cinderella.  I recreated the story in my mind so that a girl with big feet got the prince.  The prince in my story would say ""See, there is an empty space in the shoe.  You can't be the girl I love.  The girl I love has the biggest feet in the land!""
	As I grew older, though, I did not want to be Cinderella.  The only things she accomplished were being nauseatingly chipper and marrying a prince.  Marrying a prince just did not seem like enough to me.
	I am glad I live in a time, in a place where everything does not depend on having small feet or marrying a prince.  I want my life to be more interesting than that.  I believe in the freedom of having a life that is not determined by arbitrary standards.  I believe in big feet.

All I have are my videogames and my parents. I move away from any friends I made in six months, so I just said to myself ""Screw it, I just won't try to get any."" I feel so alone, and I have recurring memories of all the wrong things I've done in my sixteen years when I try to sleep.
Some of these memories are dark and foreboding, of things that I haven't even done, but could've. Others are recalls of the worst things I've done, and they come back to haunt me. Still even more of these things are things that I really shouldn't think about. These are the things that are evil and wrong in the worst way possible. They didn't actually happen, but they're evil. I usually gasp and snap out of these memory-induced trances. They're frightening. But what's even more frightening is that it comes from me. There is no stimulus, like a horror movie or a dark occurrence, to cause this chain reaction. It comes purely from my mind, and it scares me.
People always ask why I play videogames so much and endorse violence, but not violence in the modern context, and this is my answer. The reason why I don't play games like Grand Theft Auto or things like that, yet I play games like Mortal Kombat almost fanatically, is because the violence in the Mortal Kombat games isn't real. It's purely in the realm of fantasy. I don't play games like Grand Theft Auto because the violence can make horrible things I've done come up in my memories. I wouldn't touch a GTA game with a thirty-nine and a half foot pole. These games are the only stimulus I have experienced that kicks up these memories. I shut off the game and put on something a bit more humane, like Sonic the Hedgehog.
Some say that the young know nothing of love. That is only half-true. We know of love. We've seen the sappy movies, read the cheesy fan fiction, read A Tale of Two Cities. We know OF love, but know nothing of how to experience it. I've had two girlfriends, and 50% of the time; they were more adventurous than me. My complete lack of courage, foresight, and clutch (as in the part of your brain that keeps you from saying something stupid to your significant other.) keeps me from getting a girlfriend that likes me, and my over-abundance of fanaticism, insanity (not in the medical sense), and chaotic love of video games and violence leaves me unable to keep one for very long.
The things that most children take for granted, friends, family, familiarity, and comfort are things that have flown out my window on several occasions. And this I believe, is my curse, and my salvation.

[Sung] ""When I needed a neighbor, were you there, were you there? When I needed a neighbor were you there? And the creed and the color and the name won't matter: were you there?""
We used to sing that song in school assemblies when I was growing up in Wales. I didn't know what a creed was, and the people in that school at that time tended to be a roughly similar color, but still, I knew my Bible stories and I got the gist: everyone I meet, I am supposed to treat as I would God. Every interaction I have with another person is an interaction with the holy.
When my mother died this past summer, I encountered God in the most unlikely places. Mundane social exchanges became overstuffed with significance. The airline ticket salesman on the phone, who struggled to find the right flight, the right price, and the right words to say to a customer whose mother was quite definitely dying in the next twenty-four to forty-eight hours; talk about grace under pressure. That's godliness, isn't it? The bank clerk who expressed her sympathy and sorrow when my father and I went in to close my mother's account; she sounded almost as though she were praying. 
The kindness and grace of these encounters lit our path through that twilight zone between the death and the funeral, where so much business is conducted. After forty-eight years of marriage, to be exposed, without his wife to cover his side, for my father everything was raw and painful. The most casual slight was keenly felt, so that when someone was kind to him, I was disproportionately grateful, as praise-filled as though the bank clerk were God herself. And because there was more kindness than unkindness among the strangers we met, the image of God in each encounter was easier to keep in mind even when it was not well expressed. It became my job, in those moments, to reflect roughness with gentleness, a turned back with an outstretched hand. 
Of course, the excess emotion and heightened sensitivity, even the extra gratitude, were a trick of grief; but they were a welcome reminder of that old song, and they turned it on its head. When I needed a neighbor, friends, strangers, amazingly and wonderfully, you were there.
So, this I believe, now more than ever: that touching God is as easy as reaching out to the person next to you.

Every Christmas night, my family goes to my Aunt Terry's for dinner.  Everyone would arrive and of course my Uncle Rueben's family would be the last ones there.  We would wait for what seemed like hours for them to arrive with presents and laughs for all.  I still remember the kiss on the forehead he would always give me while asking me how I was, and my mother was.  We had lived in Austin for years, and we didn't get to see them too often.  The laughter would fill the room as we played bunco and Philadelphia Rummy.  Then it would be time for prayer and food.  The food was always Honey Baked Ham with all the trimmings, and bread rolls.  Always, always good, and always, always filling.  Presents would ensue with cake to follow.  Then the night would be over, and we would all wish each other the best till next time.  
     But the Christmas of 2005 was not the same.  My Uncle Rueben died of May of that year, crippling my grandparents and the family to mere carcasses idling around the same house every holiday.  My mother went into a deep depression, and the one thing to help her was the memory of every Christmas, watching home videos given to us on newly fastened DVD's.  Memories of her little brother, boxing on their beds and opening Christmas presents together filled the living room before his death.  But after it was like that video and those memories never existed.  She would cry herself to sleep, and I would only be able to hold her and try to comfort a broken heart.  But when we had ham and rolls, her smile would return and we would be able to laugh again.  Truly laugh, from the depths of our hollowed out souls, so broken only a glimmer of hope might be able to come out.  
     And it was only at Christmas dinner, once again with the family, waiting for my uncle's family, now known as my Aunt Debbie's family, to make their grand entrance once more.  But prayer was not so easy any more.  The once seamless strain of words wishing a happy new year and healthy lives once again, now filled with rips of tears from all, and though the children were trying to keep quiet, it was hard not to think about anything else then my 75 year old grandmother kicking and screaming after she realized my uncle was gone.   But the food, the food was still just as amazing. The comfort of these two foods was more than words could express.  I love them to this day, and every time I eat them, together or apart, and remember the good times, the happy times.  
     Then I think of the good times to come, and the laughter buried within us.

023093.txt,Marian,,Under 18,"Madison, Wisconsin","January 24, 2007",2007,This I Believe,community,"One of my most important beliefs is community. It's the belief that affects me most in life, because I use it every day. I believe that everyone should have a community to support them. Some use their church or religious congregation as a community; some use their family; while others, like me, just use their friends. Well, I shouldn't say just, because sometimes friends are the best community you can have. When I have a problem or I'm feeling sad I always go to my friends, I hate to say, even before my parents sometimes. In return of course you have to support your friends, because what kind of selfish person receives help without giving?
	Last year at one point someone told me I was so annoying he wanted to hurt me, and so I started thinking that nobody liked me, but they were all too nice to say so. Some of my very good friends brought me back down to earth by convincing me that people do like me. This is when I realized how much one needs support. My seventh grade teacher, Ms. Fay, brought this into even more light for me while we were discussing why people would join a gang. The main reason was that they wanted to belong to a community. It's amazing that they were that extreme just because they need something that I can get every day. I think that since I figured out how important community is, I've tried to help my friends as much as I can. Community support is a two-way street.
	There are different types of friends, just like there are different types of communities. I have one group that is good for a laugh when I'm feeling down. One group listens to me when I have subjects I want to discuss, and one group helps me achieve goals that I want. So maybe you need more than one community, unless you can find an omnipotent community that can do everything.
	I don't know when I realized that my group of friends was a close-knit community (probably a long time ago) but I do know when I realized I need them. It was Winter Break, 2006. I was driving in the car with my dad, feeling kind of down, when he asked me what was wrong. I said nothing, because I didn't know, for the moment. I began thinking why I would be feeling sad and I realized that I missed my friends. They made me happy.
	I guess what I'm trying to get across is that you should support people. Some people aren't as open as I am to say that they need help and support. In fact, sometimes that is the hardest thing to say. So you should always be prepared to help your friends, because even if they don't say anything, you are sometimes the best community they have.

023319.txt,Ryan,,Under 18,"Madison, Wisconsin","January 29, 2007",2007,This I Believe,creativity,"Music
I believe in the power of music. It is a large piece of my life and a huge part of others lives. It can relax you and take your mind off whatever its on, if you let it. The world has been affected by music in ways I don't think it even (the world) understands. There are so many kinds of music that have brought happiness to almost every person in the world at one point or another.
Ever since I was a baby I have listened to music. My parents said I fell asleep to Elton John and U2 in my small years. I began my collection of Beatles CDs when I was 5 years old and so far it has amounted to 7 Beatle albums and a love for rock n' roll. But since then I have expanded my tastes, so-to-speak. Everything from Van Halen to Miles Davis, Jurassic 5 to Townes Van Zandt, now crams my itunes library. But that's only half of it. There is also the music I play that takes up a big part of my life. I have been playing the Bass-Guitar for about a year and a half and it takes up quite a lot of time in my life. But that's just me and to think people play music for a living. They must have very little time for anything else and it must capture their life. The interesting thing is, they don't care because it's their life! 
Now I wasn't around in Vietnam or the Renaissance but if I understand correctly, then music was a way for people to express themselves.  Through music, people led a more or less, kind of revolution during Vietnam and gave the Government quite a deal of heat, but that's just what I've been told. Also, during times of slavery, weren't messages passed around by song? Again, I never visited during this time, so I can't really say for sure. People of great musical influence that died long ago are still alive in the memories of most and still VERY famous. Take Mozart for an example. Who hasn't heard of Mozart? But he has been dead for many a year. Music has been used as a tool and will again, it has and will influence the way our world is run. 
If you think about it, there are more genres of music than I count. This is because nobody even knows them all. How could they? If you keep thinking for a moment, you will also realize that probably everyone in the world has a favorite artist. It may be a Sitarist in India to Bon Jovi, and they all have probably been influenced by music in some way. I don't doubt that even the indigenous Bushmen of the Kalahari have music of their own. That is why it is my opinion that music is the largest and best provider of joy in the world. I think that that similarity should taken advantage of and be used as a tool to bring people together.
I believe in the power of music because the influence it has had on me and millions of others all over the planet. How it can relax me and loosen my mind, the way music can control your emotions. How it has done something for every body on the planet at least once. And lastly the influence it has had on the world's governments and cultures. This I believe.

I feel like that on a regular basis.  I am not trying to gain attention or sympathy for my feelings but this is just how I feel.  
	I am currently a sophomore and I am beginning to feel like this is the last semester of high school.  It began shortly after I was accepted to college, at OU.  My brother, who is one year behind me in school, began his college search.  My dad had just received a much deserved promotion and mom began to work extra hours because in a little over a year both my brother and I were going to be in college.  
	Since the family was busy I looked to my friends. We had been best friends since sixth grade, at school we were known as ""the group"" because we were inseparable. We would go to the movies, or hang out at someone's house every weekend for six years. People would drift in and out of ""the group"" but there was always the core group of us.
	About the time that I turned to my core friends, they weren't there, so I turned to my current boyfriend.  He graduated two years ahead of me in school.  I thought he was a great guy, and at this time he and I had been together for a year, but he was going to school two hours away.  He became verbally abusive, here I was, turning to the last person that I thought I could and he was treating me like dirt.
	Now, almost two years later and many things have changed in my life except one, and that is my belief that if I were to disappear no one would notice or care.  This past Christmas break was the first time my ""friends"" from ""the group"" called me to hang out with them.  I might as well have not of gone, I don't think a single person said a single word to me the entire time.  It's not like I didn't try to include myself in their conversations, it's that no one acknowledged me. Do you know how hurtful that is?    They were too busy talking about how much fun they had last week when they hung out.  By the end of the evening I eventually got tired of trying and stayed quiet, in an effort not to be rude, I didn't leave until other people began to leave.
	I was by no means unloved as a child, I hope I am going through a phase and it will pass once I find some true friends.  But to be completely honest, I really do not know how to go about that or if I should even try because if everyone is like that I would just rather be alone.  What I mean by that is, I thought I had true friends, and it turns out I was mistaken.

I believe that being active and keeping your body healthy is very important.  Exercising and keeping my body in good shape is very important to me.  I've always been in some kind of sport whether it be little league baseball when I was little or high school and college sports as I got older.  I loved running and really had fun doing gymnastics and diving.  I played four sports in high school cross country in the fall, gymnastics and diving in the winter, and track in the spring. 
	My mom always pushed me to be a better athlete and was always there to help me when I was hurting.  My coaches also really helped me stick with all these sports that I did.  Brian Miller, my high school track coach, always pushed me to be better and helped me grow as a person and as an athlete.  He was the best coach I think anyone could ever ask for.  
College for me is so much easier when I am doing some kind of sport.  I don't think I would have been able to make it through high school with out my sports they are what kept me on time with all my school work.  Working out is what keeps my mind focused. If I didn't work out I would go crazy and also I think that the people close to me would go crazy too because I wouldn't be expressing my emotions in a healthy way. 
	Being active is a way for a person to express certain emotions in a healthy way.  I'm in a health and kinesiology class that is teaching about how to express emotions and one of the things at the top of the list is exercise.  When you exercise your body stays in shape and you are helping yourself from obesity, some heart diseases, and other health problems; you can meet new people and work on your social networking too.  Which means that when you are working out you are not only working physically but you are working your social, emotional, and your psychological wellness too.

In May 2002 I lived a self-pitying existence. I hated my job. I hated the long commute. I was 'better than this.' I planned to leave work early one day to visit my best friend. I would complain over a couple margaritas. I packed an overnight bag and went to bed.
I awoke in the middle of an ER episode. People scurried, calling out tests: ""Do a chem. panel, order a CT…""
Without contacts I couldn't see but noticed my night shirt was gone. I wore a hospital gown. I tried to raise my hand but my arms were in restraints.
A woman's voice said, ""It's okay, Mrs. Riehle. You'll be okay. I'm going to remove your restraints but you can't bite me. It's against the law to bite a nurse.""
Bite a nurse?! Why would I do that? 
Diffuse fibrillary astrocytoma. That's why. It's a type of primary brain tumor. I was conscious enough to fight EMTs and the ER nurse who tried to start an IV. I had no memory of it. I apologized.  
I was referred to one of the top neurosurgery practices in the nation, which happened to be right here in Cincinnati. A biopsy gave the diagnosis.
I would be given six weeks of 3D conformal radiation treatment. My hair would fall out in patches. What could I expect? My radiation oncologist told me not to expect much in the first MRI after treatment. His hope was to shrink the tumor between 25% and 50%.
That's when it happened. People everywhere started praying for me, sending emails, cooking meals for us. Some of the top physicians in the country worked on me. People from my church and neighborhood drove me to daily treatments.
My tumor shrank nearly 70%. 
I was overwhelmed by all the good will. 
People ask me, ""Doesn't it make you want to say, Why me?"" 
Absolutely. Why me? Why were these people being so good to me? Many barely knew me. Why was so lucky to have this incredible medical team? Why was I one of the fortunate few in the world with access to such care? Why was I so lucky my health insurance covered everything?
With brain tumors, you're never considered cured. It's not a question of if but when it will come back. It came back again and again and now a third time since my first diagnosis. Two craniotomies and a round of chemo later and I'm still here. 
I feel like George Bailey. I have a gift very few people will ever have: I will live the rest of my life knowing just how precious it is. I really do have a wonderful life.
I'm the luckiest person in the world.

This is a question that has been asked to me by teachers, students, and even random people on the street. Well, I have an answer for all of you out there, and it's a very simple one. ""Who can look at the girl with pink hair and not smile?"" Since I was small it has been my goal in life to put a smile on every person's face I meet, even if it's only for a few seconds. To accomplish this goal I dye my hair neon pink that fades to bubble gum, dress in very bright and odd clothing, and walk around with a smile on my own face, leading by example. I get ogled at by small children, smiled and pointed at, and even laughed at on occasion. I've been told many times by many people that they rarely ever see me without a smile on my face and a light in my eyes, and when they don't the tend to steer clear of me. Some call it unnatural, fake, and disgusting that I can keep a smile on my face and a positive outlook even when things seem so bad that they can't possibly get any worse. But I've seen what a simple smile can do. When a friend is crying because a relationship ended or a test was failed, a simple hug and a smile does wonders to light up the face and dry up the tears. When I am feeling bad, even if I'm not letting it show, walking down the street and seeing a stranger smile at me makes my day brighter and my mood better. When a passerby stops to stare or ask, ""is that real?"" I know that my goal is being accomplished. I have had conversations with complete strangers about bleaching, dying, the brand I use, and the effect it has on my hair. Almost always these conversations end with a wave and a smile to pass on to yet another person. Smiles, like sneezes, are contagious. They brighten up anyone's day and make the world seem a little better, if only for a while. I believe in making people smile, because I know the effect a simple smile can have.

024630.txt,(John),,50 - 65,"Sun City West, Arizona","February 23, 2007",2007,This I Believe,nature,"I believe in solitude, not the ice caves of Superman's Fortress of Solitude or the enforced isolation brought about by solitary confinement, but in the restorative power of a moment alone. The secret is in a moment alone snatched from the maddening crowd when chorus converts to a solo, dialogue to soliloquy.
     I recall a moment in college when I was down. Grades had not gone as well as I'd hoped, a girlfriend had moved on and a new residence had left me without friends within easy reach. Outside, I skirted the dormitories and walked along a bush-covered gully that ran into now-you-see-them streams, which fed into the river and disappeared after the rains.
     In the suburban wilderness, accompanied by Chokecherries, Hawthorns, and nascent Mulberry bushes, I wound my way along seldom used paths, feeling the wonder of discovery – the discovery of nothing but that I belonged to this world. My mind leapfrogged from surrounding farms, to the topography of Iowa, to the prairie plant-life, and finally to the Ioway tribe which gave their name and lives to the land. 
     In the background, the songs of cicadas and birds orchestrated my walk. Without thinking and as quickly as the shift of a breeze, I joined them, singing my heart out, my voice blending with the wildlife choir. I sang enthusiastically, but poorly, belting a high note that for a better singer, might have been elevated to falsetto, trilled into a yodel, or lowered to a less challenging octave. Instead, the note grated between the epi and the glottis of my vocal chords and emerged as a prolonged squeal. Plants subjected in sound experiments to my squeal or to heavy metal, would have flourished to In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida but perished with my rendition of Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.
     Alone, my vocal failure bothered me not one bit. Instead, I returned lighthearted to my room. With that briefest of exposures to land and sky, I had been renewed. My next semester's GPA would rise, with effort I could be dating soon and a bicycle would provide contact with friends, not to mention exercise. No logical process had occurred to explain the change within me, only solitude.   
     I recall a Psychology construct called Locus of Control, which seemed to explain the unexpected rejuvenation. The concept, perhaps oversimplified, holds that people feeling controlled by outside events, experience stress or its evil twin, depression. Call my moment alone solitude. Call it quality time with myself, call it whatever you like, but I believe that time alone with you, your best friend is the compost heap that generates emotional capitol and reserves to fund investments in others.

024858.txt,Elaine,,30 - 50,"Birmingham, Alabama","February 26, 2007",2007,This I Believe,golden rule,"My mom called last night and said that my dad would be dropping by to spend a night or two on his way to Texas. With a pounding headache and with my pager buzzing, I blurted out that I was completely sapped, moaned that this wasn't a good time to have a house guest, and whined that I hadn't received any advance notice of his trip. And yet I adore my dad. For the rest of the night, I felt flat-out foul. Yes, I was exhausted after a trying week while battling a cold, but how could I be so heartless? Where was the daughter who treasured her dad and would welcome him to stay, despite his Pig-Pen style, at any opportunity? Why couldn't I grow up?  Admittedly, this was an instance where I forgot to count to five. 
You see, I believe in counting to five. Not the rapid-fire, in-a-single-breath counting to five, but rather the one-Mississippi, two Mississippi variety. As I careen through the day as though I were driving 80 miles per hour, taking even the briefest time-out in demanding situations decreases the number of times I have to shift into reverse. It is the weapon I wield against being reactionary which is, for me, the most gargantuan verbal sinkhole in the world. 
In my perpetual haste, it's not necessarily that I will say something inappropriate. It is that my mouth opens like a horse bursting out of the gate in a false start as I inadvertently convey a message arising from self-centered and self-serving instincts. It is that I won't seize a moment reflect upon my reaction and thus I won't replace my impulsive response with one that I myself would want to receive. It is that in stressful situations I can become irritable and that my unconsidered words and tone fail to express graciousness or warmth or level-headedness. Simply, it is that I will barrel forth and allow my frustration, tension, or resentment climb into the driver's seat. Later I find that I cannot reconcile how I responded with how I truly wanted and needed to have responded, employing all of my faculties of rational thought, compassion, largesse, and patience. 
I've heard that people don't remember what you do or say but they do remember how you make them feel. If I remember to reflect on that truth, then each day holds innumerable opportunities to fulfill my aspiration to be a benevolent and honorable person. And I scurry past those opportunities when I rashly respond, whether it is in the middle of an argument or in the middle of the night when I am becoming frustrated trying to explain something to a parent. So the next time you note a very long pause on my end, please know that I haven't fallen asleep. It's just that I am counting to five as I am calling on the very best parts of me and trying to avoid the penalty of a false start.

024940.txt,Nicole,,Under 18,"Surprise, Arizona","February 26, 2007",2007,This I Believe,integrity,"Footprints From the Not-So-Ordinary
Superman, Batman, and Spiderman: just your average everyday superheroes who are looked up to by so many. But for me, I believe in the not-so-ordinary superheroes. The underdogs in a crisis who do not get the credit they deserve. People like teachers and parents, or siblings and friends, and hey, maybe even the no-name guy down the street.
Whether you are young or old there are people that you look up to. For children, many a times, it is a superhero on the television, or an older sibling. But regardless of age, I think everyone has that one influential adult they aspire to become. Different traits, displayed at different times, with different people help us get one step closer to where we want to be. For me, my brother, sister, and mother are all inspirational heroes in my life who help lead me down the road of success with their motivating footprints.
Lets face it: adults are humans too, and because of that, they make mistakes as well. My brother has recently wormed his way into my head and helped me understand that it is okay to make mistakes. A few years back, his life was not going as planned, and he tried to take his life, which is something my heart will never forget. Although he is slowly making his way down the right track, my brother has been through hell and back, and it has shown me that, given time and effort, you can bounce back from even the deepest of scars.
When given a question like, ""Who do you most admire?"", my first response would be, ""My sister."" Becoming pregnant at only sixteen, my sister has struggled with life ever since, but not once has she given up. She has worked hard and continuously displayed her strength and character like never before. Now, almost fourteen years later, she and her family have finally found their way out of the pit of poverty and into their realm of dreams, truly giving meaning to the phrase ""everything is possible if you just believe"".
Although I have previously mentioned my siblings as my not-so-ordinary superheroes, nothing can come close to my mom. At a very tender age, my father passed away, and my mother was forced to raise my sister and me as a single parent. The hardships she has face were never known to me until just recently, and I have come to realize what an amazing woman she truly is. Putting her kids first and teaching the proverbial lesson of right or wrong, my mother has swallowed her fear and carried on with the courage and strength that I know she possesses.
Being a child still myself, I have come to discover that not all choices in life are easy, and that it is good to have those heroes to look up to. Adults in our life leave their footprints in the sand, and it is up to us to decide to follow or not. At the end of the day, no matter how much character they infuse us with, they are just that: footprints. Over time, slowly but surely, the rising tide will claim them as its own once more, and it will be our turn to become those not-so-ordinary superheroes.

	I believe in embarrassing moments. Everyone has them and no one can escape them. There are just some people who are more embarrassment prone than others, like myself. I've had a great deal of embarrassing moments that I often was ashamed of , regretted, and thought of myself as stupid for committing such a klutzy move or making a dumb comment.
	One of my most pronounced embarrassing moments occurred just last week. I was in my Chemistry class right after lunch where I had just eaten sugary food and goofed around with my friends, who only heightened the sugar that sent my whole body into what felt like an electrical buzz. My mouth was endlessly blurting out random things and telling stories and ideas until even I didn't know what I meant. The bell rang for class to start and my body was still rushing with energy. I could not stop giggling and neither could my class. The teacher scolded us politely and asked us to all settle down, but our laughs continued to come out. We tried to muffle the chortles but some came out as snorts which got us all into a riot again.
	About five minutes later, the class had finally stopped chuckling and began taking notes on polar molecules, but that thrill was still in the air. The teacher explained to the class, ""The molecule is a dipole. Separate it di-pole. Di-"" and she paused. Since I was not thinking properly with the surge of excitement going through my head, I blurted out, ""Di!"" Apparently, we were not supposed to repeat it, 	and the class, including myself, was sent into an uproar of laughter. This came to waste another five minutes of class but for the rest of the period I would think about what I had just done and snicker.
	Looking back on what I had done, I think, ""Yeah, 	that was pretty embarrassing,"" but I don't regret it like I used to. I figured out that if 	I put myself down after an embarrassing moment, it opened a door for others to make fun of me too. Now, I just laugh at myself thinking about really how embarrassing that moment was. I guarantee that some people will remember that one moment for awhile but it won't make a huge impact in my or their lives. So why not just laugh at myself for now? And by the time I'm old and look back on my years as a high school student, I'll have the fond memory of having a bunch of laughs thanks to all of my embarrassing moments.

025171.txt,George,,50 - 65,"Marion, Massachusetts","March 2, 2007",2007,This I Believe,Christianity,"It makes me very sad to think of all the people in the world for whom this life is as good as it gets.  Cetainly my life has brought me great joy:  my wife of 40 years, 3 children and now a grandson, travel, adventure, and much love.  But it has brought me sorrow as well:  the death of my father (too young), the loss of jobs and a career, seeing people I loved and trusted turn against me, and all the war, evil and suffering I've seen over the past 60 years.
   But I believe that life continues after our mortal existence.  Why?  Because I believe Jesus rose from the dead!
   On the face of it, that's one of the most unbelievable, fantastic claims anyone has ever made.  Is there anyone else in the history of the world who has made this claim:  ""I am the resurrection and the life;  he who believes in me…shall never die.""?  Jesus made that claim, and then backed it up by overcoming death once and for all.
   When I hear about the latest attempt to discredit Christianity (by James Cameron, director of TITANIC), it saddens me to think of all the people who will be swayed by this latest bogus ""proof"" of Jesus' mortality.  As the apostle Paul wrote, ""If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.  But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead…""
   Logic and reason tell us, of course, that simply stating a proposition does not make it true.  It could be strongly argued that no life in history has had a greater impact for good than that lived by the Nazarene some 2000 years ago–yet even if that is true, it doesn't prove that He is alive today.  
   When I was in college (Yale) many people around me made the case that there is no God.  As much as I wanted to believe, my mind could not be convinced of the basic truths of Christianity.  Even C.S.Lewis's compelling autobiography SURPRISED BY JOY was not enought to convince me.  It wasn't until I gave up and surrendered to the love of God that I discovered the truth for myself.  I simply prayed and asked the Spirit of Christ into my heart–35 years ago, in Kalamazoo, Michigan–and the world became new.  I was born of the Spirit, all my sins were forgiven, and I immediately had the assurance of eternal life–not by my own reason, logic, or goodness, but simply by the grace of God.
   This reminds me of the time I saw a butterfly ""trapped"" between a window and a screen–which had been opened at the bottom.  As long as the butterfly flapped its wings, trying to escape, it could not get out.  But once it became exhausted and fell to the bottom of the window, it was able to step right out into freedom!
   ""You ask me how I know He lives?"" the well-known hymn asks…""He lives within my heart!""

025195.txt,Nicole,,18 - 30,"San Francisco, California","March 2, 2007",2007,This I Believe,self-knowledge;sports;work,"I wipe the sweat out of my eyes as I run past the Potomac River. To my left, a girl cries out that she can't go any further — which is pretty much how I'm feeling, too — and her friend encourages her to hang on just a little longer. 
Putting one foot in front of the other, I count in French to fifty, trying to distract myself from my thighs muscles screaming in pain, my right ankle's dull throb. Mile 19 passes in a haze of bright sun, and I am focused only on making it to the next aid station. 
When I finish the marathon, I don't cry; my body is too dehydrated for that. I can't believe I completed 26.2 miles, the farthest I've ever run — or walked — without collapsing. I am exhausted, salt drying in uneven tracks on my arms, my legs are sore and wobbly — and I've never felt better in my life. 
I believe that running is more than simply exercise.  I believe it pushes me to go farther than I ever thought possible. I believe it is more than even a way of life — it is life.
I had always been a recreational athlete. Throughout high school, I played basketball and soccer and ran track, and I loved the way my body felt after a hard workout. Making that basket or running a 100-meter sprint to reach a personal record was a euphoric experience.
But running satisfies something deeper, and more elemental. It allows me to set a goal — one that is actually achievable. When I started out long distance running I had never even run five miles; the first 10-mile race I signed up for was daunting. I finished, but it was a struggle and I felt sick and exhausted. I wondered why I had done that to myself, and vowed to take a break.
Yet I always came back. I trained better, pushed myself harder, and my times improved. I set goals for myself, and met them. I signed up for the 2005 Marine Corps Marathon, logged more lonely miles during training than seemed fathomable, and crossed the finish line with a grin on my face. I can't wait to do another one.
When I run, I breathe deeply. My body finds its rhythm, and settles in. As my feet slap down on the trail, my mind wanders. The world seems infinite and ripe with possibility.
I believe running makes me stronger. I've learned I can accomplish anything I set my mind to, even if it hurts sometimes along the way. 
In this movement, I exult.

Black Boots Remembered 
Black boot prints; 
They were the first thing 
I saw on the door, 
As the ratcheting of handcuffs, 
That sound, 
Reached my ears. 
The free man, 
The democratic man, 
Was being led away 
To a terrorist's gallows; 
A dictators pulpit, 
To be bandied as the 
Sacrificial Mutt. 
But Mutts have teeth, 
They have been known 
To slip their chains. 
Thoroughbreds, 
Rearing hind leg, 
And pissing on, 
The feet, 
The foundations of, 
Fascist ideal, 
Of mustachioed, 
Uniform clad 
Rats. 
Aye I remember, 
The black boot prints, 
I remember the boots, 
We used them to knock down 
A German wall; 
Russian Built, 
I remember, 
The ratcheting of those handcuffs; 
Slipped over the wrist of a Panamanian, 
Binding his drugged dirty hands. 
Those black boots, 
Yes I remember, 
Counting them in flag draped coffins; 
U.S.A. stamped on the bottom, 
Black and bloodied, 
Strong and sturdy still. 
Foot prints that any good man would walk in. 
Those **** black boots, 
Spit shined to high gloss, 
Measured steps, clicking, 
At the Tomb of the Unknown, 
Remembering, 
Honoring, 
Their footsteps.

It was the night before our research paper was due and all I could think about was how I was going to come up with 5 pages of English about a book who's author i didn't even know. I sat down at my computer desk, thinking so hard about what seemed like everything other than English. What was stressing me out the most was, knowing that i was going to have to wake up at 5 a.m. for soccer practice that would consist mostly of fitness, after that would come a full day of school, and then practice again until 6 p.m. I finally got some sort of push to start writting. The only problem was that i was writting about something that made no sense what so ever. Every 10 minuets i kept checking the clock and getting side tracked on how I could be peacefully sleeping, and refueling for the long day i had ahead of me. Somehow I managed to come up with 5 pages of something for my paper. Do you know that feeling when you get finished with something that you dont enjoy doing, and you just feel so relieved? Well that's not what i was feeling at all. I looked at the clock and couldnt believe it was 2:30 in the morning. That meant I was going to have time to maybe get a quick nap in. When my alarm went off at 5 a.m. I just thought to myself that what was ahead of me was some kind of joke. I felt miserable. At practice I was completely useless. I had no energy what so ever. On top of everything my coach was constantly yelling. When school started all of my teachers asked me if i was okay because I looked so worn out and gross. As if the day couldnt possibly get any worse, I found out I had a pre-cal test the next period. As I was taking the test, I realized i had forgoten everything. When school finally got out the only thing that was running through my mind was how bad I wanted to go home and pass out. But I had another practice unitl 6. It was miserable, non-stop jogging and sprinting. After practice was over I couldt tell you how I drove myself home, I was completely delirious of everything. As soon as I walked in the door I thought to myself, thank god i'm home. Never again will I do such a ridiculoud thing. This is why I believe in a good night sleep.

	I believe that the world would be a better place without religion. First I would like to note that I'm not an atheist, I have a religion and I believe in it. The only problem that I have with religion is that it separates people. People have suffered greatly due to religion. The Holocaust, Jihads, Crusades, and other religious wars could have been avoided if religion didn't exist. Religion also increases discrimination between people. The Protestants have looked down on Catholics and on Jewish people. Although discrimination doesn't occur as much as it used to, it is still a serious problem in the world and the world would be a better place without religion.
	Wars occur for many reasons, but the most important issues are land, power, and religion. When you think of a horrible event that has occurred because of religion, you think of the Holocaust. Millions of people lost their lives in concentration camps because they were Jewish. People who didn't deserve to die wouldn't have died. People like Anne Frank, who's only fault was being Jewish during the Nazi reign. If you read ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" then you would know the needless suffering that her and every Jewish person went through. A more recent event was the attack on the World Trade Center. The reason that thousands of innocent people lost their lives is because some Middle Eastern Man thought him and his religion were wronged. People believe in a religion so greatly that they are willing to die or even kill over it. Most of the wars or conflicts, where innocent people die, could have easily been avoided if religion didn't exist.
	It is a known fact that religion separates people. When people get to know someone, one of the first questions may be about their religion. As soon as you hear what they say you start to judge. If they they're Muslim then one may think they are terrorists and if they're Jewish then one may think they are greedy and cheap. With all religions come stereotypes and stereotypes are used to discriminate. It is also not a coincidence that every president, with one exception, is Protestant. People don't want Catholic presidents because they think that the Pope controls Catholics. The Egyptians thought that they were better than the Jewish people so they enslaved them. I know that religion brings hope to many people and that some people use religion to rise above things, however you don't necessarily need religion. Religion is good for one thing, to make somebody not lonely, to give someone another someone to talk to. Religion is just a friend. People will always be discriminated against and there will always be someone around, but at least there would be one less thing to discriminate against if religion did not exist.
	I believe that the world would be a better place without religion. Although religion creates hope among people, it also creates war and despair. In this case the good definitely out-weighs the bad Therefore, if there were no religion then there would be one less thing to worry about in this, already troubling, world.

026437.txt,Jessica,,18 - 30,"Van Horne, Iowa","March 28, 2007",2007,This I Believe,courage,"I believe that acting helps refresh who I am as an individual.
When I act, whether on stage or in front of a small crowd, nothing can touch me.  I am in a state of mind unlike any other.  I feel the adrenaline rush, my heart beating fast.
Acting for me is a break from my own personality and my way of life.  I love the feeling of being someone else—whether that person is good or evil.  I like to take traits from past characters I have played to help mold my own life.
I have been acting ever since I was in the eighth grade.  I was first cast as a chorus member in the musical Bye, Bye Birdie.  Ever since that first show, all I have wanted to do was act and act and act!!
Last year, I was inducted into the International Thespian Society.  This induction was a huge event in my life that I will never forget.  An even bigger event, however, was being cast as the lead in the spring play of this, my senior year—Anne of Green Gables.
When I practice as Anne Shirley, I become this wild, unstoppable force.  I feel a sense of calm and peacefulness when the practices are over.  I would give anything to feel this high all the time.  I battle with depression, so when I have a chance to act—I take it.
Before I go on to perform, I am usually stressing out back stage about something very minimal.  But as soon as I hit that stage, I am a totally different person.  Seeing the bright lights and all of those faces, I know that I can't let them down.  If I were to let my audience down, I would be letting myself down.  Acting offers a switch to turn myself on and off.
Anne Shirley is an optimistic little girl with big hopes and dreams.  She never gives up on anything and loves everyone for his or her personality quirks.  Anne's main goal is to merely be accepted for who she is.  Which is what we all want and need in the end.
I envy Anne's ability to see the good in folks…and in life in general.  I am trying to see through her eyes and model my life after hers.  I know that Anne Shirley of Green Gables, Avonlea, Canada is a fictional character, but I hope to bring her completely to life.  By embodying her insuppressible spirit, I feel that I can better myself and my world.

Three years ago, in my final semester of law school, thousands of miles from my family, I called my aunt out of desperation.  I had struggled for several years with depression and anxiety, but had hidden my feelings out of independence, pride and shame.  
Rather than telling me that I needed to buckle down and finish school, my aunt told me that if I wanted to leave, they would have me home the next day.  I called her and my uncle every day for the next four days, resolved to finish school and angry at myself for not being able to take control of the situation. Those days were hellish, and what I felt I can only describe as utter hopelessness and despair.  That Friday morning, I called again and told them that I needed to come home.  Four hours later, my apartment was locked up, and I was on a flight out of Connecticut with a couple of suitcases haphazardly packed with clothes, books, and a family photo album.  
When I arrived in Seattle that night, the tears I had been trying to hold in poured out on my aunt's shoulder at the baggage claim, and on the ride home, my uncle held my hand and repeated the mantra ""Annie's home.""  
Home had a restorative power. I spent the next two months in sweats on the living room couch or in a lounge chair in the yard, reading, watching T.V. and putting together jigsaw puzzles. I took the time I had never allowed myself to do nothing, and I took the time to get well.  I planted pots of nasturtiums, petted the cats, dozed in the sun, and discovered the ability in myself to let someone else help me. Before he left in the morning, my uncle would leave my medication and a twenty dollar bill on my dresser.  In the evening, I waited by the front window like a child, waiting for my family to come home.  
My life came back together.  I moved out of my aunt and uncle's house, finished school close to home, and got two cats, and started a job representing parents whose kids are in foster care.  I kept my promise to my aunt and uncle and myself to stay close to home.   
I used to have doubts about my decision to leave law school and come home.  Now I know that it was the right thing to do.  I needed to be home, and what I have learned about family and unconditional love is far greater than any theory I learned during seven years of college and law school.
This I believe: home drew me back without judgment from across a continent, and healed me. Home has the power to cocoon me in the unconditional love of family.  Home has the power to convince my soul that I am content and grateful where I am.

026743.txt,Marisa,,50 - 65,"Northampton, Massachusetts","April 4, 2007",2007,This I Believe,family,"Tight living quarters is the answer I give when friends ask me where I learned to sew and cook so well. In a room ten feet by twelve feet, I cuddled with my father on a small sofa and watched the only TV in the apartment as my mother—a tape measure dangling from her neck and straight pins clenched between her lips—sat at her sewing machine and created Easter suits, Halloween costumes, and slipcovers. She folded strips of buckram that interfaced the upper edge of endless yards of antique satin, into miniature accordions until a pair of pinch-pleated drapes resulted. Wet dishtowels were applied over wavy woolen seams and then pressed with steam on the ironing board she would set up in that room. There she spread out dress patterns on the only wall-to-wall carpet in our home. To this day, I cut fabric on my living room floor; sticking pins into the rug's backing the way my mother did holds the cloth in place.
In that room where I read magazine short stories and my first novels, my mother's conversations with her soul mate Florence (on the only telephone in the apartment) were but an earshot away. The heartaches of a neglectful husband or a meddlesome in-law were discussed; feelings comforted; solutions established. 
In the adjacent kitchen, a Formica topped table placed against the wall provided the sole counter and desk space in the apartment. If I tipped back my chair, I could rest my head on the sink and touch the stove at the same time. I did my homework on that table while, alongside me, my mother dipped veal cutlets into egg and flour mixtures, being careful not to touch my textbooks with her batter-coated fingers, as she helped me analyze poetry. At the other end, my father graded his students' homework, composed exams, or shined his shoes. I ironed my father's white handkerchiefs on that table. There, my mother brushed up on her stenography and typing skills as she prepared to reenter the workplace outside of the house. 
I have never attended a home economics class. No one ever explained to me the difference between frying and braising, boiling, blanching, and simmering, or that egg whites were stiff enough if they didn't slide out of the bowl when you turned it upside down. No crash course taught me the necessity of preparing for a day's work, or the art of diplomacy, or how to be a good friend and parent.  I learned it all by osmosis in an apartment where privacy was not a luxury; where the bathroom door held so many layers of white enamel paint it didn't close properly, let alone lock.
I believe that not having my own space in a time when communication was not a silent operation or individually owned mediums of entertainment not as necessary as a toothbrush, I learned some of life's most valuable lessons. I believe in protecting children from the isolation of privilege.

My family is at a crossroads right now; we rewrite the definition of caregiving each day as our situations change. My father, suffering from middle-stage Alzheimer's disease and congestive heart failure, entered a nursing home six months ago when he had a heart attack and experienced a significant physical decline. My mother, never having lived alone, finds it difficult to function in her suddenly empty two-bedroom apartment. When I call her, which I now do several times a week, she is peering through her curtains into the parking lot, visualizing all kinds of frightening things happening ""out there"" that will sneak up the stairs and harm her. I've been to her home many times, and there is nothing dangerous out there. It is a quiet, gated community in a beautiful part of Florida. 
""It's ok,"" I tell her, ""your imagination is running away with you."" Perhaps this is one of the childlike aspects of getting old, reacquainting oneself with the world of fantasy and dreams, no matter how dark.
My three siblings and I are far away–two are in Michigan and I'm in California. The one sister who is close enough to take my parents into her home is the one who could never live with them. (And they wouldn't live with her.) It is ironic, given this silent discord, that she is the one who has helped them the most. She navigated the Medicaid maze and got my Dad into a highly regarded care center, near my mother, with an excellent and compassionate staff. He is happy there, he says, except that my mother isn't with him. Each day, he packs his bags and sits on the side of his bed with my mother's photo in hand, claiming that the doctor has discharged him, and that she can take him home. The nurses smile over his devotion to my mother, and I think, if I moved to Florida and got a house for us all, they could be together again.
But I believe we must know our limitations, and that we must set our own standards for what we think is the right thing to do. I believe that, by calling and visiting often, researching and providing solutions to problems, and offering an ear—and a shoulder, when I am there—I am caring for my parents. Sometimes I feel that, by living 2500 miles away, I am not doing enough, and that I should leave the life I've created here and move closer. But honestly: I see that as an act of self-destruction, and I believe that the best definition of caregiving would never exclude the Self.

""Live. And Live Well. BREATHE. Breathe in and Breathe deeply. Be PRESENT. Do not be past. Do not be future. Be now.""
One brick, two brick, three brick, four; I counted up to fifty before the sound of the Charger Band caught my ears and diverted my attention else where.  As I walked up the Albuquerque Academy's campus path headed for the first assembly in the gym, about a million thoughts paced back and forth in my sixth grade mind.  Fear seemed to weigh out the most in the end; fear of the future, that is.  I worried who my friends would be, if the teachers would be nice, and if I would ""fit in"" at my new school.  
As my journey took me through middle school and into my high school years, the fears changed from one day to the next.  There were endless worries such as, what outfit do I wear to the 8th grade dance?  Will this pimple disappear before picture day?  Will the boy I love choose her over me, again?  Will this grade bring down my entire GPA?   The one thing that these questions all had in common is that they were uncertain of the future.  We as a people seem to constantly worry about what life holds in the next year, the next day, even the next minute, and sometimes, we even think our lives aren't going to change, even to the point that we think we can predict them.  Sometimes we can get caught up in this little world that everything will be okay and things won't change, and that we know exactly what we're going to do with our lives in the next 10 years. But the truth is, it doesn't work that way. As I've started to ""grow up"", I've learned that this thing we call life has so many twists and turns that sometimes it's hard to keep up.  However, the good news is that there is one thing we can all be sure of, and that is that nothing in our future is certain. What it all boils down to is that no ones got it figured out just yet, so why worry things about that we have yet to receive the answers to?
Now, seven years later, I walk down that brick path as I head to my graduation ceremony.  Still, I do not know where I will be in my future or what I will desire out of life (as it is sure to change incessantly); but there is one thing I do know, and that is I will not fear the future, but rather I will embrace the present.  
I believe the closest thing we have to our future is the present. Would you really want to see how your life ends up?  Personally, I wouldn't.  If you know what lies ahead, where's the fun in what lies at your feet right now, in this very moment?  Think about your life now, and clinch it, love it, want it.  When you are secure with what you know, everyone will see that.  It will draw people close to you, and that's when everything starts making sense, that's when everything will be okay.

	Many people's lives are engulfed with pressures from work, school, and even family. This pressure soon turns into stress which can be a major hazard on ones health. However, I believe that music is the cure to the problem of stress. Music is one of the most relaxing things ever put in this world, and it does wonders when you are stressed out and don't know how to deal with problems in life.
The best example I have for this is from two years ago on Fathers Day. My mom had planned a huge dinner consisting of fresh lobster and grilled shrimp. While sitting down for dinner my mom had brought up the topic of my senor pictures being the next day. This was the first time that I had heard anything about this and told her there was no possible way I would be able to make it because I had work. My step dad Charlie, who I have never liked, decided that he would join in the conversation and say, ""your job doesn't matter, and you can always find another summer job.""
	I became really defensive because I loved my job and I would have no reason to quit just to have my picture taken. However, Charlie stuck to his point of view and my mom jumped on the bandwagon with him. As I saw that my family was turned against me I got very frustrated and turned to Charlie. I shouted, ""You have made my life miserable for years, and I don't want to deal with you any longer so just get out of my life!"" Once I had said this I stood up and walked out of the house to go take a drive and calm down while listening to music. When I came back neither my mom nor Charlie would say a word to me.
	However, I had cooled off enough to say sorry for what I had said and that it was out of line. Though I did not agree with his side of the argument still, I did not want my stress to get the best of me. To this day Charlie and I don't say more then a few words a week to each other. I know that if I didn't have music to calm me down enough to say my little apology that things could have ended up a lot worse.
	Music has saved me more then once and I don't think I will ever find a better cure when I need to mellow out. For me it's not only a stress reliever, but also a life saver when things get hard. The calm that comes over me when I listen to music is as though I have left all my problems behind and everything is perfect, and I'm sure it's the same for many other people in the world.

I learned as a child, that everyone has a spark of the Divine in them.  This beautiful thought held me in good stead for many years.  But, as I matured in my system of belief, something new grew from that thought.  I began to feel an intimate connection with the world around me.  I remember the first time I opened my eyes and knew the trees were just as alive and sentient as I.  I realized that not only was I part of everything around me, but that everything around me was also part of me.  Rather than having a spark of the Divine within me, I was divine, just as all things are, by whatever name one wishes to call that.  My dad said such thinking was sacrilegious.  He didn't understand.  Having the knowledge that all things, including myself, are divine, I was no longer free to judge indiscriminately.  Every time I judged someone else, I also judged myself, because we are all built from the same cloth,  part of the same house.  And a house divided against itself cannot stand.
This belief expanded when I returned to college and read Hawkings Brief History of Time as part of a New Testament course.  Something Hawkings said created a framework that reinforced my belief in the divinity of all things.  He described an experiment that involved passing a single light atom through two barriers, one with a single slot and one with two.  In the first instance, the shadow created by the light atom was crisp and clean, demonstrating the atom had taken a single path.  When the barrier had two slots, the shadow created by the atom became fuzzy.  This indicated to Hawkings that apparently the atom had taken not a single path through the slots, but many.
This brought into focus for me, an understanding of the workings of the Divine.  Since I believe all things are the Divine, the Divine then is like the single atom.  From this, I developed a maxim summing up my belief which provides, for me, an understanding of our divergent paths.  Like the atom, ""We are all manifestations of the same Deity, seeking every possible path to our destination.""
It's not always easy to remember this in a world of crime, anger and conflict.  However, it helps me to be more considerate, more compassionate, more understanding.  When I look at someone, I am reminded hat I am looking upon myself.  That person, too, is the eyes, ears, hands, and mouth of the Divine, and as such, deserves to be seen, heard and understood, whether or not I agree of him or her.  It also helps me remember that every tree, stone, drop of water is also that Divine wholeness and, as such, deserves my honor and my protection just as much as my friends and family.  After all, in my mind, we are all the same.

While Arnold and Sylvester movies were in their prime, the ones that are the most important to me to this day are what I call underdog movies. These movies usually start off by having an unlikely character turn into the hero who gets the girl by the end of the movie. 
	The Goonies was one of the first underdog movies that I remember seeing. A group of plucky pre-teens, along with their older siblings set out to find a dead pirate's treasure, so that they can save their homes. Along the way they dodge bullies, bandits, and the traps set by dead buccaneers; finally getting the gold, confidence, as well as their first kiss. Despite everyone trying to stop them, they succeed. When one of them fell, whether it be a physical pit, or a metaphorical pit of despair, a friend was there to pull them out.
	The Goonies never gave up or caved to the pressure of others; as they were often heard to say: ""Goonies never say die!"". This never-give-up attitude is one of the ideals that I hold close to my heart. 
	I have been faced with many personal, scholastic, and professional situations where surrender would have been the easier option, but I do not accepted defeat so readily. To be honest, at those times, I did not reflect back on my childhood and think ""what would the Goonies do?"", but their message of hope did linger somewhere in the back of my mind. 
	After growing up a hopeful child, I was seriously assaulted on my college campus. I sunk into a depression which marked it's low point with me secretly dropping out of school. I was ready to give up on life until my family was there to pull me out of my depression and give me the support I needed to recover. Knowing that I can recover from such a scarring incident fills me with hope for the future. 
	I believe that there is little that can stand in my way if I put my mind to it. With the support of my friends and family, I believe that I can recover from any injury to my person, or psyche. I believe in Hope, I believe in ""Never say die!"", and I believe in 'the Goonies'.

I never thought I would drive back to where my house had once been and nothing would be there. Walking over piles and piles of rubble to get to a house that is not even there anymore is the hardest thing I have ever had to do. It is so hard to put into words how it feels to have to go through that. 
	Walking over rooftops and refrigerators, I still did not believe my house was gone.  It did not hit me until I saw a pair of my pants I had not even taken the tags off of lying on the ground covered in mud. It was at that point that I knew that my life was forever to be changed. I kept walking, tears filling my eyes, until I finally reached where my house and my car used to be. It was at that point that it hit me; everything I had ever owned or cherished was gone. I broke down into tears. I do not think I have ever cried as much as I did that day. It was not tears of sadness for losing everything I had once cherished, they were tears of fear. Where were we going to live? Where would I go to school? Were all of my friends alright? How do you bounce back from something as tragic as this? I will be the first one to tell you that I was scared. For weeks after the storm, it almost seemed surreal. I cried a lot in the weeks to follow because I was scared. I knew I had my family and friends but for once in my life, I really was homeless. I had no place to call my own.
	Slowly, everything fell into place. I ran out of tears. We stayed with my older sister, whose house was not damaged, for a long time after the storm, until we finally found a house to rent thanks to one of my mom's friends. I missed seven weeks of my senior year of high school because of Katrina, and when we went back, my school was in trailers. After the storm, our entire senior class became closer. No matter where you went, everyone was there for each other, and for that I am forever grateful. 
	I believe that August 28, 2005 happened for a reason. That reason was to make me stronger and to help me appreciate what is important in life. Life is not all about material possessions; it is about friends and family. Without all of them, I am not sure where I would have been after the storm. Sitting here almost two years later, I am still a strong believer that everything happens for a reason.

  I believe my grandfather is with me everyday
I believe that my grandfather is with me every day. He passed away many years ago when my dad was sixteen and left eleven babies behind. As I grew up my dad was always my hero and my idol. I always wondered what my grandpa was like; I was always questioning my dad about what he liked to do. My dad answered ""he was just like you."" 
As the years went on I would think about my grandpa all the time in everything I did. Because dad said he was just like me. There are many events that make me believe that my grandfather is with me.
My younger brothers and I played a lot of baseball. When we hit our first homerun there was a monarch butterfly on our bats and when we ran the bases it flew with us. It was a question to ponder so we asked our dad about it. He smiled with joy. That's grandpa. He told us the story about when grandpa was going to see the angel and what he said. Grandpa said ""When I go to heaven I want to fly free like a monarch butterfly, I want to feel the wind upon my face."" I immediately started to cry. Here all along this butterfly that was with me was my grandpa. 
Winter came and everyone knows that butterflies are not out in the winter, but this one was. We have a cabin and it was given to my dad because he was the one out of all the children that spent all the time up there with his dad. We were unloading things from the car and went to the trunk and out came a butterfly. We all stood there in complete shock and we watched  it fly high and then low and then down to the lake.  He was there all weekend with us and he left when we left.
After all the days grandpa had been with me, I thought I would get something for the days that I don't see him. I got a monarch butterfly tattooed on my lower back with a beautiful flower that he sits on. I don't know my grandfather and I have never seen him, but I do believe that he is with me everyday and he will always have my back.

I believe in this philosophy.  It may be above our power as to why this happens or maybe it is the result of our actions, but I do believe that every single thing that happens to us during our lives is for certain reasons, whether we learn from them or grow because of them.
My father was a very skilled golf player through his high school years.  During his senior year, he was offered a scholarship to play at one of the top Division One schools in Ohio.  As he began to train harder and harder to prepare, he put his body through intense physical training.  One day, he ended up hurting his elbow so badly that he had to have surgery.  The result was that he was no longer able to compete with the best golfers and instead he chose to attend a small university to play golf.  At this college, not only did he receive a good education, but he ended up meeting my mother.  They soon fell in love and after six years of dating, they finally got married.  Today, they are still happily together and have had a total of four children.
I believe that there was some sort of strange reason as to why my father hurt his elbow and couldn't succeed in playing golf.  If he didn't get hurt, neither my siblings nor I would even be here today.
I believe that things like that happen to every single one of us everyday.  They may not all produce results, such as meeting the love of your life, but I think that instances that happen daily affect all of us.  When you make a mistake, usually you are able to learn from it, something I believe happens for a reason. 
For example, I dated someone for a year before I realized that we were totally wrong for each other.  I kept dating him though because I felt like we would be able to work through our difficulties and that we would be able to make our differences go away.  Well, after another year of dating, things only got worse before I knew that we had to end it.  I soon realized that after dating someone totally wrong for me, I knew what I wanted from a boyfriend.  That relationship helped me realize what I was really looking for, and if I hadn't gone through that one, I never would have realized what I wanted.
Everything we deal with doesn't always have to involve romantic choices.  There are many other examples I could use to express how this philosophy has affected my life.  When I was younger, I was shopping in a grocery store with my mother.  Somehow, I weaseled my way over to the candy aisle (without my mom knowing) and saw the massive amounts of candy being displayed in clear containers.  The temptation was too much for my young self, and I had to open up the container and grab a handful of those delicious looking gummy worms.  I started eating them, and before I knew it, was tapped on the back by an employee who worked at the grocery.  I got caught red-handed and was escorted back to my mother.  That fateful day I was taught how wrong it was to steal things.  My mother made to sure to punish me to show me how much of a bad decision that was.  To this day I would never even consider stealing anything because that lesson has stuck with me throughout all the years.  
I truly believe in this philosophy.  It can affect our romantic choices, create lessons that help develop who we are as people today, or involve other aspects of our lives.  Whether we learn from or grow because our mistakes, for one reason or another, everything that we do happens for a reason.

028502.txt,Thomas,,Under 18,"Denver, Colorado","May 5, 2007",2007,This I Believe,forgiveness,"If someone has wronged you in some way, then I'm sure you've experienced the urge to get revenge on that person. Of course, we don't think of it in such a dark way. No, we just change the word 'revenge' to something a little nicer, like 'getting even' or 'getting square'.
 It happens every day. Someone at school trips you and you drop your books. So later in the day, you trip them right back, and then we say those three little words that supposedly make everything all better. ""Now we're even."" How exactly does that make it better? We've all heard the term, ""Two wrongs don't make a right"", and yet we insist on getting even with each other. I believe that part of the reason is that we (as people) are so self-conscious about ourselves. If someone were to get tripped, they would feel humiliated. They feel that they must trip that person back to show that they are not completely powerless. At this point they think that they're even, and the whole situation will just fade away. But instead, it snowballs. Each person doesn't want the other to get the last shot, so they keep taking shots at each other until someone gives up or until someone intervenes. Of course, this doesn't happen with everybody. Most people are mature enough to either laugh at themselves, or just drop it without stooping to a lower level.
A personal example is from a year or two ago, when me and a couple of buddies were having a snowball fight, and before we started we had agreed not to hit anyone in the face. But during the fight, I misjudged my aim and hit one of my friends in the face. I apologized and went to see if he was alright, and he said he was, so I just went back over to my side. This friend, however, was short-tempered, and not one to let go of things like that easily. We resumed our battle, and after a while I was hit in the face with a snowball. It was so cold it made my face numb. I wiped the snow off my face and my friend said in a mocking tone, ""Sorry dude! It was an 'accident'!"" then laughed to his friends. I said, ""Alright, you hit me back. We're even, so drop it."" But wouldn't you know it, another snowball from him hit me in the face. Fed up, I walked over to him, we traded expletives, and before I knew it, we were punching each other. Our friends eventually dragged us away from each other, but not before we had exchanged a couple good blows. Tasting blood, 2 of my friends helped me up, and I washed my cuts inside. From this I learned that some people aren't content with just getting even. They don't consider it even unless they get a reaction, and my friend was obviously trying to pick a fight. 
I also learned that two wrongs really don't make a right. There's no way to replicate the exact thing someone did to you. It always has to be unfair, like ""You hit me harder than I hit you!"" or something. Two wrongs don't make a right, they make even more wrongs.

Educating immigrants will benefit them as well as American society.  
I have been teaching ESL (English as a Second Language) at a Houston community college since 1999.  When I first started, I wondered whether I was fully qualified for the job, having formerly only taught children.  I wondered whether teaching immigrants English,  some of them illegal, was the right thing to do.  Was I not aiding in making it easier for immigrants to stay here, thus having them encourage more of their friends and family to come to this country?  I wondered about immersion English versus bilingual education.  This and many more doubts plagued me until I came in contact with my first class.  I met people from all over Mexico, Central- and South America.  They were most eager to learn, the most diligent students, some of them working 2 jobs and still making time for 6 hours of instruction per week plus homework.
The more these students taught me about their cultures, their daily routines, their learning styles, the more I wanted to become the best teacher I could be for them.  It has become clear to me that immigrants are here to stay and if I am to be a spoke in that wheel of reality, I want to be a useful one in our mutual learning process.  Yes, indeed every day that I am in the classroom teaching English to about 20 immigrants, I benefit so much from what they can teach me from the perspective of their diverse lives.  I often have students from five different continents and the interaction between them has become as important as their language acquisition.  I see myself as a facilitator of their total learning process.  To that end we use English as the common instrument of understanding and respectful listening, social, and communication skills to encourage mutual open-mindedness and acceptance.
Often when immigrant students first come to our intensive English program, they are riddled with fear and self-doubt.  Well-functioning individuals in their own language and culture, they face multiple hurdles before they can feel some measure of competence and confidence again.  In that sense, I have the utmost empathy, having come here as an immigrant myself a long time ago.  My goal now, along with teaching language skills, is to foster hope and a can-do attitude, pride in being bilingual and becoming valuable members of American society.
I have come a long way in my teaching skills since that first class in the fall of 1999.  Also, I believe now without a doubt that we must educate immigrants in order to integrate them more fully into our American lives, and I am happy to be an ESL teacher.

It is not in my conscience to look at a man and say if they meet a prerequisite to be human. That is his job.
Again I say, I was raised to love knowledge, to seek freedom, but mostly to find real, longstanding joy instead of momentary pleasure. This gives me purpose. I find my meaning here, but I know many people have their own take. Most people don't care about the intricacies of a computer program. I find real entertainment in comprehending them. On the opposite end, I find football drab. My brother thinks I'm an idiot for that.
Man kind's problems start when one man thinks his way is perfect. Undefeatable. Anyone who disagrees is a waste of flesh. This is why Indian shop-keeps get assaulted, why homosexuals can't marry, why Hitler's plan worked.
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is more than a cliché. Man has a right to all of them, and each gives way to the next. Without life, there is no liberty, without liberty, we can't be our true selves. Without happiness, life is a burden, rather than the joy it could be. Of course, we still have to find that happiness.

Terrorism is just another inevitable result of unjust and unfair behaviour on the part of some against others in the world. It will never end until the behavior of enough leaders in the world changes to support a higher degree of ethical and altruistic thinking that will allow a higher level of civilization to evolve for the benefit of all living things and the world they live on. 
This concept in no way intrudes on any of the underlying philosophical beliefs concerning appropriate human behavior associated with any of the major religions or othe types of philosophiical thinking that exists in this world. On the contrary, it is the only way those beliefs will ever be able to take root and evolve into worthwhile human behavior.
The history of the world clearly shows that this change will never occur through leadership alone. It requires the collective actions of as many individuals as possible in all societies. They must do everything possible to insist that their leaders follow this road to a better world.
So, the quality of the future is up to each of us as individuals, not to our leaders! We can choose to put our individual shoulders to the wheel of progress towards a quality of life that is better for everyone, or we can ignore our individual responsibilities and take the consequences.
The choice does not seem to be a difficult one to make. It is almost incomprehensible to imagine that any reasonably rational human being does not want to be happy. And a much greater degree of happiness for everyone would be the result of the right choice.
It goes without saying that all this will take a long time to evolve. But it will never evolve unless each of us expends as much energy as possible in that direction.
How much more unecessary pain and suffering must occur before we collectively decide that enough is enough and insist that our leaders act accordingly?
Thank you for considering this point of view. Although the concept is simple enough, the implemantation will present many challenges. But what worthwile discovery has not been fraught with challenges?
Let's join together as adventurers and explorers to make this happen.
Sincerely,
Papa Foote; Another Fellow Human Being who needs your help.

I was sitting in the passenger seat of my friend's car. We were going down a winding road in my hometown of Andover, Massachusetts when we suddenly slid on some black ice at about forty miles per hour. At that moment as we slid right towards a telephone pole, I remember truly believing we were going to die. The violent collision literally sent the jeep bouncing off of the telephone pole, completely destroying the front of the vehicle. Through some sort of miracle my friend and I had only minor, non hospitalizing injuries. 
After the accident I felt so happy to be alive. I realized that on that day in my young high school life we could have easily died. Since that day I feel that I view life differently. In today's society death is rare among the youth, and I used to think of myself as invincible. However, I now understand how vulnerable we truly are. At any given point some freak accident can happen to anyone. I am not saying that I live in paranoia, afraid of the world. That would be no way to live. Before I pass away I want to make sure that I led a happy life with many friends and few enemies.

	""I want this, I must have that, and oh I just can't live without those!"" These words fill the young mouths of former innocent and satisfied children of past generations. If there's anything amiss and misguided in our corrupt society, it's the fact of there being too high of abundance in technology. It seems to me that, the more technology advances, the more unsatisfied and needy the human race becomes. 
	If the cavemen, ancient and insensate, could continue through life with only loincloths and tools make from surrounding sticks, I'm rather sure that we don't need all of these materialistic items that now seem to be so prominent in our individual lives. Becoming more and more greedy, each generation has everything imaginable at their fingertips. People as a whole are becoming intensely dependent on technology to the point where it's dramatically ridiculous.
	A prime example of reliance on technology would be the handy-dandy remote. Even I have succumbed to this ridiculous need. The remote for the television, the remote for the stereo, the remote for my bedroom light and fan. The most hysterical event to witness is an individual whom misplaces the television remote.

	With all the technology and tall sky-scraping buildings blocking most the luscious landscape, most everyone seems to take the beauty in nature into low regards. And instead of gazing upon the luscious green valley hills, the thick red brick and smog are now our landscaped view. If I sit back and take just a millisecond to appreciate the earth and beautiful nature life around me, I can be free from all the worldly wants and necessities. I can also teach my children to love what they have not what they want, and to love what they need not what they desire. I can help delay the corruption in some lives but a moment if I myself can take myself away from this world but a millisecond.

The memories you hold in your heart will last a lifetime. When I was a child, I loved my mother home cooking. As a child, I never knew the differences between Asian and American food. I believe that my mother cooking is the best for me. As time fast forward, I began to realize that I eat more Laotian style food than American. After school my mom would make a simple meal which includes Laos's sticky rice. I can recall every time we have parties our parent's friends would bring a lot of Laos cuisine. Some of my mother's cooking is simple or hard core Laotian style. One of my favorite meals that she makes is the Lao Green Papaya salad or Tam Som with sticky rice. Another favorite and simple food is Lao beef jerky. Oh how I my miss my Laos sticky rice! During my time as a teenager I never really appreciate my mom cooking till I move out. When I left home to serve as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Aug 18th 2004. I had to cook for myself. What will I cook eh? What will I want to eat eh? Will there be any Laos's food there eh? In Vancouver, Canada there are a lot of different culture restaurants, but it is not the same as when your mother prepares a meal. I can recall a time when I feeling the blues as a missionary and food is the best medicine for me. I do not have the skills to make the food. I keep thinking back of the food my mom has made in the past to recall the flavor. Now that I am in college 1759.00 miles away from home, it is hard to go visit. I get tired of eating American food because my body does not take it in, and I get seriously ill. My mothers cooking fill me up and make me happy. Whenever I feel sad and need to eat for comfort, I can not get it here in college. The only solution is making the dish myself, but I am no expert at Laos or Thai food.. Yesterday I tried to make Laos Green Papaya salad, it tasted good, but not the best. The taste did not match my mother's version. I can cook some Chinese food and I am proficient in sushi making and Japanese food. But my culture is in Laos, so I am dying to partake of that food more than any others. The first 3 months from returning home, my mother cooked at least 5 days for me. She knew that I had not had Laos's food for two years. I am an adult and still I desire mama cooking. Why eh? Because I can never quit eating mothers meals. It is part of who I am and the food that my mom makes will shape who I will become.

	As quickly as a summer thunderstorm ruins a warm sunny day, my sister's illness hit my family. Hard. Fast. With no warning. It was as though my sister who was once happy, healthy, and brilliant was now a shell of what she once was. As my family grasped frantically for threads to a treatment that did not exist my sister lost more and more weight, until food became a life and death matter, with my sister fighting help every step of the way. Suddenly the path to recovery became clear: simply to make my sister eat.  Which is why I believe in the 2,000-calorie smoothie made each morning by my mother. 
	Each day, my mother would make my sister a 2,000-calorie smoothie, although my sister did everything in her power to refuse drinking what she deemed as a ""drink from Satan."" My mother remained patient with her, even after she pulled numerous tricks, such as hiding a cup in another room to spit out the smoothie into. Sometimes my mother sat at the table for hours waiting for her to finish her smoothie and the crossword puzzle she did to take her mind off the calories.  The tricks my sister had up her sleeve were endless, and it seemed that my mother's once brilliant idea had failed. The relentless fighting from my sister, and the undying love from my mother, continued as my sister slowly regained the pounds she had shed. We had heard, from other families going through the same suffering, that once they reach a hundred pounds, treatment becomes easier. However one hundred was the number my sister feared most. For almost five weeks, she kicked the intensity of her tricks up a notch, determined to keep her weight at ninety-three pounds. With a little help from Paxil, one of the many drugs my sister was prescribed during the summer, she reached a hundred pounds, and like predicted she fought less and ate more. As a wave of relief flooded over my family, we were encouraged by the progress, continuing to regain the sister and daughter that had once brightened our lives. Slowly but surely, in four more weeks, she was as healthy as ever. However without the help of the strawberry blueberry smoothie she drank each day to ensure a high number of calories per day, the treatment plan would have failed before day one. Although her illness is still clear today she often complains about feeling fat and having no friends, with love from my family, and calming drugs she is able to suppress the urge to starve her. 
	Mention of the smoothie in my house is still reason for anyone to cry both tears of joy and sadness. Although the illness hit like a storm on a summers day, it didn't pass quite as fast, instead of leaving a small stamp on the future, like wet grass and a closed pool for the afternoon, it left a permanent stamp on my family and sister alike, as we still feel the effects of Anorexia Nervosa daily, two years from the awful two years we lived through. Which is why I believe in the power of tender love and care and the 2,000-calorie smoothie that worked together to save my sister's life.

Her comments about black kids were not only ignorant and hurtful, but further contributed to the stereo types and hatred in our society.
I am 28 year old, Afro American female professional, who attended an inner city school in Richmond Va. The majority of my class mates were well behaved, productive students. Many of which went on schools such as Virginia Tech, Morgan State, Virginia Union and even a few made it to Harvard!
 I have no kids, but am recently engaged, invested in my 1st home at 24. I am an inspiring writ er/musician who has played piano since the tender age of 6 and fell in love with the Cello at 12. I love roller-blading and karate and enjoy listing to music that ranges from Soul to Rock to Reggae and Rap and Country. I love traveling and learning of cultures and history not spoken of in text books. And yes, I am Afro American!
	I have relatives with professions that range from  Politics,  Medicine and Education, to those who live check to check and struggle to stay on track with the law.
I recently attended a NEO Soul / Latin concert and my heart flourished at the sight of thousands of Afro Americans with dread locks , kinky f ro's and natural braids side by side with Caucasians and Latinos. My mind drifted as I was serenaded with the rooted sounds of the Congas and flutes and the holistic idealism that fell from the full lips of it's proud song birds. The audience teased my eyes as their Afro centric and native American jewelry flirted with the many shades of brown skin, vanilla and cocoa. There were a few gold chains and baggy pants, but no fights. An environment popular in many places like Atlanta and CA, which are more diversed than VA..
Maybe this young lady and others like her, Black and White , have never exposed themselves to  anything other than their poverty stricken  neighborhoods or the garbage that reflects on  BET during peak hours. 
Some of my kin folks may stereo type this young lady as poor white trash, living in a trailer park  on drugs, none ambitious and racist? Another Stereotype that I also condemn.
Maybe she never popped in an Erica Bad, Floetry, Tracy Chapman or Anthony Hamilton CD? Or visited one of the many places in America and abroad where her stereotypes are just a myth.
Its sad that we were stripped of our heritage 400 years ago and the generational impacts of slavery still exists today. Statistics show that most people stay within the class that they are born, 
From the failures of our educational system, to the  epidemic of drugs in our neighborhoods. I look at the 1st gangsters in the US during  the Bonnie and Clyde and Bootleg alcohol days. The learnings of such destructive criminal activities were not ideals brought from the black slaves  in America.  But when will the psychological impacts of the damages caused by the inhumanity of American  history end?
So, to the young lady and others who insist on continuing to degrade and negatively stereo type any race, I urge you to educate yourself and your children ,expose them to the diversity and beauty of all cultures. Appreciate their roots and individuality and show pride in the blood of your ancestors. From Italians, to Nigerian, to Japanese to Russian to, Irish to Puerto Rican, to Haitian  and all in between. We are more than Black and White and Yellow. We all have a heritage that goes far beyond our skin! So take time to learn to love yourself and appreciate our unique and beautiful differences!!! This way of thinking has made my life joyous and and full of spice! What a wonderful world we could live in if everyone took the time to do the same! We are not defined by our bank accounts, race, or status, but our souls within!

030310.txt,Annie,,18 - 30,"El Monte, California","June 12, 2007",2007,This I Believe,brotherhood & friendship,"Since my early childhood, I've always believed true friends were a rarity. If I were to define what a ""true friend"" was to me, I would say that this friend would accept me for who I was and vice versa, and we would be friends despite distance and time. 
It's hard to determine who is a genuine friend, since there is not much of a distinction between who is a friend and who is a colleague. As a child, I was eager to obtain as many friends as possible. So, every student part of my classes or around my neighborhood becomes a friend. The older I get, the bigger the circle of friends become. Of course, not everyone in that circle can be regarded as friends, perhaps more like acquaintances or classmates.
From my own experiences, I believe what creates the ties between my close friends and I together during elementary and high school years are the classes we shared. Not everyone shares the same interests, but we do share classes. So, those that I've been with since school first started, sometimes end up becoming part of the inner circle, though not always. The lines start to blur between what is a friend and what is, more realistically, only a classmate.
It saddens me when, as the years go by, how many of those friends we had become distant figures that I only know as a classmate. Even as we speak now, I am not sure who I can regard as a true friend. Perhaps I feel some are my friends because I talk to them, but there are those that I regard as friends even though I don't interact with them regularly as others. The separation of classes and interests also play big roles in the distance placed between us. It sets my mind to think about who my genuine friends are.
As most of my classmates and friends go our separate ways, I believe this is when my true friends will be found. Distance does not always force friends apart. At times, it can help to determine where the real friendship lies. Acquaintances are common, but genuine friends… one-of-a-kind.

030325.txt,Tracy,,30 - 50,"Denver, Colorado","June 12, 2007",2007,This I Believe,parenthood;peace;self-determination,"I believe in the power of calm.  Although sometimes it belies how I really feel inside, the exterior of calm works wonders.
I try to use Love & Logic with my children, the secret being calmness and kindness when doling out discipline, even when (especially when) I want to get mad and yell.  When I am mad and I yell at my kids, the release feels good to me temporarily but it doesn't solve the problem and I look no better than a child having a temper tantrum.  When I am calm and kind in offering up a natural consequence it works so well and they are left to deal with their problem, rather than me.  The power of calm in discipline is key.
After about 20 years of being a devout atheist, I recently discovered God through the writings of Neale Donald Walsch and his books called ""Conversations with God"".  I had been so turned off by the misuse of power and aggressive evangelizing by some religious groups, not to mention the mixed messages about God and religion that I turned it off altogether.  To this day I am still rather quiet in my spirituality so as not to turn anyone else off like I was all of those years, but I believe that a calmly enthusiastic book suggestion from me will be much more powerful and helpful to my friends and family who are interested in spirituality, than the ravings of an evangelical zealot out to fill up his particular church or hell.
In the environmental arena there are some people who still believe that humans are not the cause of global warming, let alone that it is a problem.  Naturally, these people feel uninclined to make changes toward improvement, and there are many others that just haven't given it a lot of thought.  Just as my children don't respond well to me yelling how right I am about something, or how repelled I was by fundamentalists preaching salvation with threats and negativity, I've noticed that people who are not yet environmentally conscientious do not respond well to overly passionate people screaming at them to save the planet or suffer the doom and gloom consequences tomorrow.  I've made a few calm suggestions to groups I belong to about reusable canvas grocery bags, canceling paper phone book deliveries and the like.  The response has always been so positive.  I believe people do want to do the right thing, but they want to be approached with calmly enthusiastic, respectful ideas about making changes they can live with, one at a time, rather than complete salvation my way all at once or face hell as a logical consequence.
It is said that the meek shall inherit the earth, but I believe a plausible interpretation of this saying is, the calm shall inherit the earth, and we will make it cleaner and safer without any yelling, threats or tantrums.

I am a recently married woman (or so they call me), with no children and trying to finish college. I have two goofy daschund dogs (doxins, doxie, wiener dogs, whatever you want to call them), a playful cat and a wonderful loving husband that provides for me. I am six months away from becoming a certified Intervention Specialist (Special Education teacher) and I could not be happier. This I believe I am just trying to do my best. 
My journey through life has had many adventures and many obstacles to overcome. I believe that through my savior Jesus Christ that I am able to achieve the outmost important things to me. I believe that He has put me in the path of special education to help educate people to love one another. To teach each other we are all the same. To rid each other of stereotypes and judgments. He strengthens me by teaching me that we are all God's children and we are all the same. He has only provided me with opportunities like the one I am in now to help me see more clearly and more colorblind. 
Working in an education field and now working with a family whom have five adopted children and are trying to adopt at least two more children, I have learned a lot about life. Not only are the children all children with special or unique needs they are all of different ethnic backgrounds. The mother and father are both Caucasian with five grown biological children. They have adopted three African-American and Caucasian bi-racial children and two African-American children. Being in such a world destroyed my judgment I had to do the best I could and not pass judgment on what they might become because of what society has portrayed or better yet expected them to become. I had to look past the stereotypes and believe that they too are no different from me. I believe I did the best I could for now when I see them, I see no color.
The world sees too much color and we judge by that color. When things are seen as black and white with no in between, we see the true meaning behind it. We are too quick to judge when we should be more quick to help our fellow brothers and sisters. This I believe the world is better off colorblind. I can try and make the world a better place by teaching them the beauty this world has to offer when we see things with no color, but it is up to this world and people to make the greater judgment for their own. This I believe I am just trying to do my best.
I live a very blessed and wonderful life. I have been given this opportunity to work with children with special needs only to help myself grow. When I grow, I help those around me grow too. I teach them to love all of God's children and to ban those judgments that society has of each of our ethnic backgrounds. I learn everyday ways to help children with many different ethnic backgrounds, many different lifestyles and many different special needs, but I cannot help them if I cannot help myself. I cannot help anyone if I cannot look past the color of his or her skin. I have to make my world and myself colorblind and non-judgmental to help others. I believe that through God I have made myself just that. I know I cannot change or help every person, but knowing I can help a few makes my life complete. This I believe that I am just trying to do the best I can.

030675.txt,Emma,,Under 18,"Santa Monica, California","June 20, 2007",2007,This I Believe,brotherhood & friendship;change;forgiveness,"I believe in forgetting memories.  My good memories define my past while my bad memories define my knowledge.
I believe in keeping some memories while letting others go.  I learned at an early age that trust is not an easy thing to maintain.  Once I got into a huge fight with my best friend.  The idea of her lying to me haunted my every thought, it was a memory that I refused to shake off.  I asked myself whether I deserved the decency of honesty or whether it was a quality too hard to find at such a young age. Today, looking back, I realize how trivial the whole situation seemed.  On the surface however, during that moment it overwhelmed me, I felt worthless and dispensable. This situation taught me a much greater lesson than the power of honesty. 
Till this day, I cannot remember the actual cause of this fight.  As time passed, I realized that it was not the lie that haunted me it was the memory of how I felt and the tears I cried.  
It is hard to let go of some memories, however some memories deserve to be forgotten.  We should look back on life and see experiences and adventures, not solely a plethora of regretful memories.
It takes a strength and courage to know when to move on and forget about the past.  Many fear that doing so will reveal a painful vulnerability, however I have learned that after enduring the pain a weight is lifted and it is finally easier to breathe.  The liberation and freedom we feel after weeding out the bad memories from the good is a rare cure to the feeling of abolishment for any remaining guilt.  It is important to learn how to alter a bad experience into a learning experience.  If we do not the sadness and sorrow would serve no purpose.
I believe in moving on.  The power of dwelling can paralyze our minds and souls.  Dwelling prevents logic and reconcilliation, it is a virus that can be cured through the transformation of harmful memories.  
This is not merely about a lie or a fight between two young girls it's about a learning experience that simplifies my life and I learned that no matter what the case, everyone deserves honesty.  With some arduous weeding and shaping of what we choose to remember, that act of letting past and useless memories go becomes a whole lot easier.  The only difference between a good and bad memory in the long run is how we chose to remember it.

030781.txt,Georgia,,50 - 65,"Wheaton, Illinois","June 24, 2007",2007,This I Believe,family;parenthood,"When my three children were young and I was the secondary breadwinner in the family—immersed in the daily intensity of tending to their needs—I wrote a poem entitled ""The Pie Chart"" about my relationship with my husband.  In the lines of the poem, I imagined myself ""vanishing fraction by fraction"" as the slice of the pie chart representing our time together grew and the slice that was my independent life shrank.  I worried that giving myself over to caring for my family would erase ""me"".  
Later in the poem, however, I used the metaphor of intersecting orbits to describe our marital relationship, allowing the liberty to venture out into space, with the reassurance of gravitational pull back to crossing points.  I believe that those intersecting orbits are fundamental to healthy family relationships.
My children are now at various stages of exiting the nest, and I am struck daily by the oppositional forces that pull them away at one moment and reel them back to us the next.  Money, of course, is one force–each of them has a different approach to earning and spending, resulting in distinct dynamics of how they ask for help.  But the need for affirmation of life choices is equally compelling.

She never dreamed that the corporation's power over the judicial system would disrupt her future plans for years to punish an act stemming from empathy and outrage at inhumane treatment of animals.  She has used some of this time to care for her dying grandfather—demonstrating empathy and selflessness that have astounded both the family and his medical team.     
Joanna, 21, just sent me a paper to edit entitled ""The Human Ecology of Fear: Investigating the Cultural Significance of Supernatural Phenomena in the Oral Traditions of Newfoundland"", the culmination of a recent trip to the island.

Quinn, 19, is busy pulling away from his parents with as much vigor as he can muster, but I'm not worried.  I trust that his orbit, too, will lead him back toward the intersection with ours—and then send him back out again.

031029.txt,Sarah,,50 - 65,"Boulder, Colorado","July 6, 2007",2007,I Believe in Hormones,change;family;science,"Never in my years of parenting teenage girls, with four more long years to go, would I have thought I would write these words.  I believe in hormones.  Teenage hormones and adult mid-life hormones.  With all of their incredibly painful and messy consequences, they are nonetheless the catalysts of major positive changes.
Consider my older daughter, whose hormones must have kicked in at age three when she refused to talk to me for nine months after her younger sister was born.  This was a mere prelude to what began when she hit sixth grade and discovered boys.  Life became chaos, with explosions over every possible request – pick up clothes, be civil, do homework.  You would have thought I was requiring her to build a new house by herself.  Come to think of it, that might have defused the energy.  
Mid door slamming and screaming, we have finally made it to her departure for college this fall. Again, she is not speaking to me, unless a crisis develops:  ""Mom, mom, I was in a car accident and I don't have my insurance card. What's the phone number?"" or when she breaks up with Boyfriend Number Infinity Plus One.  
But she got it together to fill out applications on her own (""I don't WANT your help, Mom, I can do it WITHOUT YOU"").  When I gripe to my mom, she laughs and says, ""Well, you wanted to raise strong independent girls and you succeeded.""  Without the hormones prompting rebellion, she never would have broken away from me, not an easy task.  She and her sister have lived primarily with just me most of their lives, and I am not exactly the meek, mild, and submissive type of mom who makes cookies:  ""MOM – why can't you be like the other moms???""
Her younger sister did not hit the hormonal years until ninth grade, when she metamorphosed overnight from a child whom I thought would never turn into a tiger into an MTV Frankenstina.  The first two years were the worst (and during those years, my older daughter became Little Miss Sunshine), but the train of boys gets more educated and accomplished all the time.  So does she.  I had always thought of her as my baby – never again.
Who am I to criticize?  Hormones put me into a disastrous relationship with someone whose career I envied.  I now have a similar career, but no disastrous relationship.  And they led the girls' father out of the closet and into the right life for him.  Were any of our hormonal manifestations user-friendly?  Definitely not, but we all grew into what we were meant to be.  I'm proud of us – all four of us.
The Buddhists, who most likely don't believe in hormones, say that emotions are the truth that lies beneath the narratives that hold us back.  I believe those emotions are hormones.

Throughout people's young life they are asked this question over and over again,

Never in my Constitution-loving, liberal-leaning, NPR-listening life did I think I would say those words.  After Ashcroft helped write the infamous Patriot Act–reviled by librarians across the nation–the Bush Administration's first attorney general appeared unlikely to take the Constitution very seriously.  John Ashcroft seemed to be exhibit one in the Bush White House's claim that the global war on terrorism was a different kind of war that required a different kind of strategy.  Perhaps even a different kind of Constitution.  
I have devoted my entire adult life to studying the U.S. Constitution and reflecting on the various ways it has been bent and even broken during times of national crisis.  I expected that after the 9-11 attacks a new set of constitutional challenges would once again test our moral fiber.  My husband was working in the Pentagon on that day, so I had a front-row seat to America's debate on national security versus civil liberty.
But I didn't expect an ideological conservative like John Ashcroft to defend my civil liberties on his hospital bed, while the White House tried to strong-arm him into approving a warrantless surveillance program.  Nor did I expect other high-ranking officials in the Bush Justice Department to join Ashcroft in his stand.   
That night–and we may never know exactly what was involved–John Ashcroft fulfilled his obligation as attorney general to defend the Constitution of the United States ""against all enemies, foreign and domestic.""  Even when that included the president of the United States.
For the Constitution to mean anything, it has to be a minumum standard beneath which no Congress, no president, no Supreme Court may fall, even in time of war.  Especially in time of war.  
Thank you, John Ashcroft.  Because of you, I have faith in the Constitution once more.

It was in the wee hours of the morning when my parents got a phone call that Brian had been in a severe accident and had been rushed to Mass General Hospital.  My parents were told that Brian would be okay; this was obviously not the case.

Unlike most, I won't be thinking of the usual things that people dwell on, like the appearance that comes with old age, or even dying. As I look at how the times will be changing in front of me, I will only be thinking of the moments that I stepped out of the norm, the times that I chose to be different not to draw attention to myself, but as a statement to my peers and ultimately the world, that I am an individual.
By choosing to get a Mohawk, I was taking a chance, not only with my hair, but with my pride as well. I have never been a guy that completely blended in with the crowd, but I had never done anything this dangerous either. I am only a teenager. (I'm not saying that to say I have it easy, I'm saying that to say you should feel bad for me.) The slightest blunder could leave me being the butt of many jokes. I nearly talked myself out of it. ""I can't go to school looking like Mr. T,"" I said. With a deep breath, I looked myself in the eyes (in the mirror of course) and said, ""Corwin, don't you think it's boring to be like everyone else?"" I stormed out the door on my way to the jungle. High School is just that, a jungle, and it is full of different species and interesting sights.
As I stepped in the door I was assured that I did the right thing when a girl said, ""Hey that's cute,"" or so I thought, I was assured, but I turned out to be wrong. Throughout the day I certainly turned heads, and sure enough I heard a ""Hey Mister T.""  All and all, it was a great experience. I heard some compliments and a couple bad jokes, but I saw I affected people. Whether they liked, hated, or just heard about it, I got a reaction out of them. Regardless of what people said, they could see I was committed to my Mohawk, because I wore it with confidence.
I made people think about their lives and why they do or do not take chances. I learned about myself and how we as people react to what's different. I will continue to be different. I will continue to turn heads and shock people. I will continue to get Mohawks. This time, I refer to the Mohawk as a metaphor—a metaphor for change. I will continue to be an individual, not just through clothing and appearnance but through deeper situations. I will prove that black men can be educated; I will prove tha the institution of family has not died; and I will prove that men can be faithful to their wives. Whether it turns heads or not, I will do these things with pride. These will be my Mohawks.

032961.txt,Vicky,,Under 18,"Charlotte, North Carolina","September 20, 2007",2007,This I Believe,humanism;peace,"When I was a young child, my mother taught me that a docile spirit was the best gem of any treasure chest. Thus I would go to school quiet and obedient. Peaceful. There, I would watch as the other kids misbehaved and fought like starved dogs over a scrap of meat. Tempers flared and simmered, seething glares were exchanged all to the teacher's mantra of ""There will be no fighting in this room whatsoever!!"" Well, even this meek little child could witness the Alpha Dog struggling to the top of the pack, and even this respectful little girl laughed at the absurdity of her teacher's demand.
I'm not a belligerent person by nature, nor do I condone senseless fighting-but I honestly believe that the Utopia of peace, this mythical somewhere over the rainbow does not exist. I too like so many others in the world find myself pondering the same questions. Those questions with which trying to produce an uncontroversial answer to would be the same as attempting to wrap my mind around infinity or nothingness. What is the meaning of life? Is there a God? Why is there no peace? 
Now I could stand on a pedestal with a bouquet of flowers all I want, crowing out the injustices of war all the while dreaming of closing my fingers around the Holy Grail of the end of suffering. I could- and in doing so, would achieve nothing. Holding the belief that peace is nonexistent paves the road of my life with values like perseverance, pride, ambition, and compassion.
It was then that I leaned that it was human nature to fight, to compete, to be the best of the best. That same primal instinct to fight that my ancestors felt has embedded and etched itself onto the strands of my DNA. With this innate drive within my very being, I learned perseverance and ambition. In proving myself and making the most out of everything I had been gifted with, I was prepared to kick, claw, and force my way out of the crowd. Others gift wrap this process with sweet words such as doing your best- but I knew the rules of the game. If I played peacefully, the only place I would end up was dead last. I hold my head up with pride at my achievements.
Yet along with this pride, I learned compassion. Due to the realization of the nonexistence of peace, I glimpsed for the first time the Great Rift Valley that separated me from the world's depravity. Upon seeing those who were too weak to fight, I found the pity and desire for good that tempered my ambition; the strength and raw passion I unearthed only served to augment what makes me human.
When gazing upon the inevitable battles of this world, I stand as a modern day Athena, waging war upon all the bright frozen smiles and shining tiaras of the world because this I believe: There is no such thing as peace.

I find this passive pressure holds who I am in a cage. My thoughts and ideas are held firm by the shackles of my assumed image, the person I want people to see me as. To be myself, who I am truly meant to be, I reject the judgments of others and do not judge in return. 
I was a very  introverted person in middle school, constantly worried that I would stand out and be the center of some very  unwanted attention, or be an outcast from society. My life continued in this manner for almost my entire stay at Meadow Park, until one day  in eighth grade. I was forced out of my shell of normalcy for a writing project. The project was, quite simply , a free write. Before this I wasn't allowed to write what I wanted and, quite frankly, I was terrified. But true to the assignment, I wrote something completely my  own. My short story, ""Shadrin Rising"", was actually my very first book idea, but that comes later. In this my main character Mephiro was learning magic and eventually had to leave to find a new master after the untimely death of his former one. Well, needless to say, I was nervous. I handed it to one of my peers for his opinion. I was expecting a bit of scorn or ridicule, but after he finished he just sat there for a bit, then he said something that really  changed me. He said, ""I want to read more."" This changed my outlook. If one person actually liked my ideas then chances are that other people would like them too. 
So by the end of the year I had changed drastically from the timid closed up person I was to, eventually, who I am today.  Because of those few, simple words, I am no longer afraid to share my ideas or opinions with others, even argue about other dreams and hopes. So, it is my belief that everyone should be who they are. To forge a new perspective on what life is. Or don't. It's your choice.

The evening sun streamed through the dining room curtains on what had been a calm August Sunday only moments before.   The long-distance connection was clear but I was sure I had misheard.  I lost a few of the words that followed but she didn't even break stride, continuing a paranoid tale that she was convinced would end with her losing me forever. 
It wasn't me they were looking for, Mom insisted.  It was the other me.  She was beside herself with worry and I was only able to calm her by promising that I'd leave Virginia for her Greenwood, South Carolina apartment as soon as I could pack a bag.    
It must be her medication, I thought.  What else could it be?
On the road, I placed a call to my favorite aunt.  Mom was talking out of her head, yes, but a question was digging at me and I had to ask.  Is it true?  My aunt's silence was answer enough.  
I'm thirty-two years old and I just found out I'm adopted.
Her doctor said that it was a problem with Mom's medication and within a week she was fine and back at home.  We talked a lot those few days.  Another woman gave birth to me, but I only had one mother. 
Months later when curiosity finally got the better of me, I learned that there would be no first-hand accounts to answer my questions.  Mom had suffered many traumas over the years and her memory was failing.  Surviving family knew little more than I and all others had passed away.  The only chance lay in a phone interview with the retiring lawyer who had handled the adoption.  
South Carolina does not give up her secrets easily but two weeks after our talk, struggling through his shakily-written response, I lingered on one sentence.  There are some things you might not want to know.
It was not an easy decision, but I let it go.  
Today, I remind myself of why I made that decision nine years ago.  A childhood climbing trees beneath a bright blue sky.  Graduating near the top of my class.  Proud years serving in the US Navy.  Standing on both coasts, the islands of the South Pacific and the sands of the Middle East.  Four brilliant children.  A beautiful and loving wife.   And now, making decisions daily that steer the jobs of dozens of people.  My life isn't good.  
It's fantastic.  
Forty-one years ago, a woman walked into an attorney's office with a baby boy.  She took a pen in her hand and changed the lives of her family and that of a childless couple.  I do not know her thoughts then or if she thinks of me now, but on that day she gave up her six day old son to what she believed was a better life.
Life is wonderful and we all deserve a chance to live it.  This I believe.

What you might think of a song can completely contradict what another might think.  I believe music is a language everyone can understand.  It can be classical or rap.  Jazz or country.  Music is something almost everyone listens to.
Last year, I traveled to France to perform for audiences there.  I went with a group of about 30 students.  We had three performances around France.  There was one at a convalescent center, one at the Luxemburg gardens, and one in a cathedral.  At every place we went to, many people knew the songs we played.  At the convalescent center, we had a fun and touching experience.  Although most of us kids in the group didn't know French, we were able to communicate with the French-speaking elderly.  We were able to communicate through a common love of music.  When we were playing one of the songs, Minuet, by Boccherini, one of the men in the audience shouted in French ""Oh! It's Boccherini!""  He was so excited that he started dancing around.  That raised all of us performer's spirits because we were glad the audience was able to connect with us.  Also through our performance, it gave the elderly audience something to look forward to.
At our next performance, we had the same type of reaction to our pieces.  True to our nationality, we played a country piece as well as a ragtime piece.  Although our group came from America, and supposedly French citizens don't really like Americans, they were very respectful to us because we played music and pieces they knew.  When we were done playing, we were shocked and touched.  Some of the same people who we had played for at the convalescent center had come to watch us.  Within the three days separating our performances, they had made a petition and had it approved by the head of the facility.  We were touched because they had to drive at least 2 hours to get there.
Between our second and final performance, a couple of us went to a cemetery.  Although that doesn't sound very interesting, entertaining, or fun, it actually was.  At the cemetery, many famous musicians were buried there.  There were multiple composers from the 15th through 19th century, also, a musician from the late 60's by the name of Jim Morrison.  As we were on our way to find a famous composer, named Frederic Chopin's, gravesite, we got lost.  One of the girls in our group who came with us spoke French, so she asked a passing man for directions.  The man actually was from Spain, and didn't speak French, but was able to tell us directions in Spanish.  Since I had been taking Spanish for at least 3 years by then, I was able to communicate with the man fairly well, and be the translator between him and the rest of our group.  Although our director did not understand Spanish, she seemed to know I was telling him about our group.  Since he was conversing with me and I was playing a solo, she told him slowly in English that I was playing a piece by Rachmaninoff.  Music helped us communicate because as soon as she said Rachmaninoff, he was very surprised and impressed with me.  He took my hand and kissed it as a sign of respect.
At our last performance, we performed in a 300-year-old cathedral.  Word had spread about our group so much that the chapel was full.  So many Frenchmen came just for our music.  At the end of the concert, the head priest came and announced to everyone that our concert was the first time in the history of the chapel that it had ever been a full house with not even one seat open.  Throughout my experiences, I have come to find that music is a language everyone can understand.  This I believe.

One, however shines high above the rest. It made me who I am today even though at the time it didn't seem too terribly important. Now, I believe that others can learn from this as well.
	When I was in the sixth grade, my English class read a book about the Holocaust. I didn't live under a rock and I knew that there were other religions, but I didn't really have a grasp for what their base beliefs were. During a reading from a chapter, my teacher saw fit to explain that Judaism had many of the same beliefs as Christians except that they didn't believe that their Messiah had come yet. I was completely shocked. I had no idea that the two religions were so similar. After I went home that day, I went into introspective mode.
	As I pondered the new information, I slowly began to change the way I saw the world or at least the people in it. Even though there are many different religions under many different names, many of the fundamental ideals are eerily similar. This fact made me rethink the 'us' and 'them' mentality that I had developed. Thus, I became far more open minded about my peers and other people in the world. I also became curious about other religions and why certain people in a religion acted a certain way. This led to a better understanding on my part, of others.
	Learning from an experience is what makes us human. This event has left me with many new outlooks and empathy for those who do not share my background. I should hope that many more youths and even the older population have an opportunity to learn. Even though on the surface religions may seem like night and day, they all exist to make life better for those who follow them. 
	As you can see, my religious experience left me changed. I now strive to understand others better and I use every chance I get to spread what I have learned. My passion about furthering insight is paramount. Only through sharing will we better ourselves.

033875.txt,Alex,,Under 18,"Denver, Colorado","October 9, 2007",2007,This I Believe,integrity,"I recently changed schools from a tiny twenty- five person class to a larger one hundred person class. An even bigger change for me is the lack of trust I find in my new peers. At school I live in constant fear of having my text book or calculator stolen. A few recent incidents have caused me to become more protective of my belongings. This lack of trust in others is a big deal to me. I used to be able to trust my peers. But now I'm left to question the morals of others. 
Another incident that left me feeling violated and infuriated occurred at my own house. During remodeling, items such as alcohol and packages have gone missing. These stolen objects have left me skeptical of the workers in my house. I'd like to believe adults would be more mature than to take another's belongings, yet my previous encounters leave me in doubt. 
People who are close to me have often borrowed items knowing I will not care. The truth is I do care. I don't care if they ask before taking. If they ask me, I often will say yes. That doesn't mean I trust everyone. I only trust the people I know well. It's not easy for me to lose my trust in someone. To lose my trust, one must first lose something of mine and then lie about it. I once borrowed a friend's book and then the book was misplaced. I knew this was completely my fault so I went to my local bookstore and bought him a brand new book. Instead of lying and having him lose his trust in me, I admitted to my mistake and replaced the book.
Responsibility is a big part of trustworthiness. If you want someone to trust you, he needs to know you are responsible. If he is not responsible and he loses your item he will not replace it. Instead he will often blame another person for the loss. Trust means you can rely on someone in hard times. If someone ruins this trust then it can never be rebuilt. 
When something of mine is stolen, I tell myself ""I can just take someone else's book. I know they won't care."" But then I think ""Would I want that to happen to me?"" Do to others as you would have them do to you, is a teaching from the bible. However, people do not seem to respect it.  
I believe someone should earn trust by being honest and responsible. I believe I can be a role model for people to follow. By not giving into what people do around me, I can help others to make the right choice. Uncivilized society revolves around the idea of taking what you need. In order to be civilized we need to be able to trust and respect the property of others.

This notwithstanding, today I sport over two dozen tattoos and several body piercing besides.  I have long hair, wear tattered jeans and t-shirts advertising punk-rock bands from the 1970's.  I have been referred to at my workplace as a ""walking contradiction,"" even having been told by some that when first they met me they were rather intimidated, an impression they soon left far behind after getting to know me.
	My beliefs can be summed up in one phrase- ""existence precedes essence.""  Who I am defines what I do.
	I was home schooled until I was ten years old.  On my first day of public school ever, as I prepared to walk out the door, down the front walk and catch my first school bus, my father said to me these unforgettable words:  ""Remember, you are different."" 
	That brief exchange has probably impacted me more than any sermon, seminar, or lecture-on-tape that I have heard since.  I believe I am different, yet I also believe that being ""different"" does not mean ""better.""  I am no better than anyone else, I deserve no special treatment, no extra consideration.  I believe that relationships, that people, are important.  Institutions, companies, these things fall to the wayside when measured against a meaningful relationship with another person.
	I remember considering exactly what Dad might have meant when he told me I was different.  I think, had he articulated the entire idea behind the statement, it may have gone something like this:  ""Remember, you are different!  Do not abandon the teachings nor the lessons you have learned in these last ten years.  You will confront a multitude of ideas and must always keep your sights true!  Hold fast to the teachings of Scripture!  You are going to see people make fun of each other, put each other down, perhaps even ridicule you for whatever reason.  Remember you are different!  As a Christian, you are responsible for loving your enemies, doing good to those who hate you and must always, always turn the other cheek!  Look for the outsider who has no friend and be his or her friend.  Relationships last!  Be respectful to the leaders at school, if someone asks you to do something, do it!  Work hard at your studies, for a workman approved need not be ashamed!  Do everything for the glory of God!  If you are afraid, remember the words of Jesus 'I will never leave nor forsake you!'  If something doesn't go your way, remember the hard words of the Lord's Prayer, 'Thy will be done.'  If someone makes fun of you, or makes fun of the Bible, don't be angry!  The best way to see the character of the Bible is to look at the character of those who oppose it!  God's Word will never fade away! Remember, son.  You are different.""
	I have remembered that I am different.  I use my differences to find common ground with whatever type of person I am around to engage them on a personal level.  I believe people are important.

Choosing to give a person a second chance is jeopardous on there half, but also reveals that their complying to risk there trust on your decision because they have your belief.   I'm one of many that had a second chance to prove my self to better than before.  I've had to show my dad that he could trust me by giving me another chance because numerous times occurred where I have created an error in what I was doing.  
Second chances serve the purpose to help you prove others wrong. Its risky for the friend or partner you lied to in the past, but if he or she is willing to give you one more chance, you have to show that you're a bigger and more trustworthy person than the past.  Believe in second chances, it's an opportunity and more than a gift. It's more than earning a promotion or wining a million dollars. You could have the nicest things and items in the world, be the richest man, and yet, you could be the most deceived man on the planet.  
	If you put enough effort into the toughest situation your in by trying to earn someone's trust back, stick to it. It takes a time range from a day to a couple of years or more to receive confidence in your honesty. After someone apprehends your word, show them how hard you worked for that one last chance and prove to everyone that you gave in to honesty and your ready for a new beginning.

Ok a nest if you're a bird and home if you're a human. This hit me instantly on the head after seeing the falls on a beautiful summer day in Sioux Falls, SD. Far from home I was out walking around from my temporary nest of the night called the Holiday Inn, but hey I was Downtown Sioux Falls you know.  After walking down 8th street after being intrigued from by a barber sleeping in his chair waiting for the next customer I saw a train crossing my path. I saw 5 train engines connected and thought oh boy this is going to be a long waste of my time while I wait for this train of one hundred plus cars. Boy was I wrong.  It gave me an belief I will never forgot again. I will tell you about that in a minute. In the meantime just imagine the rhythmic sound of the crossing gate bell and the ground vibrating from the weight of the train crossing.
Ok the belief. As I looked as the train cars go by I saw a birds nest lodged perfectly in a crevice of a train car. I thought how sad that there could be eggs in that nest by themselves. How about the parents somewhere in a Midwestern rail yard wondering where the nest went. The train was going south. Where would they hatch? At what speed? Who would be there to feed them? Birds weren't born to lay eggs in the Midwest  to have them shipped off to Texas. The birds are much different in Texas.  
Then it hit me that my own nest, (home) is not much better off. In the blink of an eye I realized that my nest might as well be the nest I had just seen because of constant traveling that goes on between my wife and I. We are gone and nobody is home to watch the nest very often. What if we had baby's at home? This made me think how long our we going to abandon our nest this often. Who is going to watch the nest if there are baby's? Well just recently I broke down in tears telling my wife the ""nest"" story and the ""nest"" story now shapes our decisions towards  creating a nest that we can care after.  It is absolutely necessary to have a place called the nest and to take care of it and this I believe.

    I believe in the magic of Disney. I know that's a cliché statement. I make such an announcement and most people give me an odd look. They're thinking ""aren't you a bit old for Beauty and the Beast?"" Perhaps. I suppose it's a matter of opinion. However, I am not afraid to say that I am a devotee of Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. I am Princess Jasmine's biggest admirer. I am a lover of the Cinderella story. 
    I believe that Disney is a return to everything that's good in our world. As Sebastian said in The Little Mermaid, ""The human world? It's a mess."" Isn't it beautiful that for an hour and a half, we can escape our worries and experience that innocent silliness that we used to enjoy as children, before we're learned of the woes of the world? 
    I believe that there's nothing like hearing the word ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" to put a smile on someone's face. We live in time when the media controls so much of our lives. The shows on TV are either violent and inappropriate or mindless and bawdy. Isn't there enough suffering and violence in our world without reenacting it on television for entertainment? Why watch such things when you can envision your favorite princess dancing through the woods? When my friends and I drive to school every morning there's a plethora of song choices. We could listen to music that only details the problems of our society. But why, when we can sing along to ""Zip-a-Dee Doo Dah?"" 
    I believe that Disney holds a message for everyone. Little girls watch these movies and see strong and independent women who will risk everything for their dreams. We could use more such people in the world. Anyone downhearted will get the message that, giving up gets you nowhere. In a little over a year I'll be leaving home for college. For me, it will be ""A Whole New World"" and I want to have the confidence to face it. 
    I believe in miracles and love at first sight. These characters tell us that there's a time for everything. They preach on the sacredness of the earth and the importance of harmony with our neighbors. They also teach us that there's a time to be little selfish and that everybody needs a little romance in their lives. 
    I believe in the immortality of the human spirit. I don't mean in a religious way. I think that we should never grow too old or too sophisticated for the things that make us happy. I trust in the idea of mind over matter. Our bodies may grow older but our spirits can stay young and guileless. If Disney movies make you happy, then keep watching them throughout your life. The world is a rough place to live. We should all find something to take a little of the stress away.
    Finally, I believe that ""if you keep on believing, the dream that you dream, will come true.""

There are so many things I wish I could have done, wish I could have thought, wish I could have believed.  It seems that I never seize a moment and make it remarkable, or even interesting.  Even reading that sentence I realize that was a lie, it IS interesting to never be interesting, at least from some standpoints (maybe medical).  But there have been things that I really wanted to be different from any other day, that haven't, and I look back on those and think of what I could have done, and wished I could have acted that way.  Looking back on what I could have done seems like something one would say after not saving someone from getting hit by a car, or from a burning building, but my situation is just really trivial I guess, ridiculous really.  A few years ago I had a conversation with my dad and sister about how we visualized normal passages of time, like days of the week, and they both had really interesting internal diagrams.  My dad saw the days in a counterclockwise circle.  I don't remember what my sister saw, but I do know that I had always seen the days of the week in a line, from Sunday to Saturday, just as I was taught, just as I assumed everyone else thought of the days of the week.  I really wanted to be able to say that I saw the days floating in space changing colors like the fish you see on TV, or something stupid like that just so it would be more interesting than a line, just a line.  Then when my dad died I wanted to be able to go crazy, to break something, even to just cry for awhile—something to show me that it was a really emotional time.  It was, so far the most in my life, just not outwardly.  A good friend of mine told me after the funeral that my eyes were bottomless, like blackholes, and I think that's the only outward emotion I had.  All I could do is sit in my room and stare at my wall when I found out, like I do when I'm bored sometimes, then calmly decided whether I should stay at school for class or go home immediately.  I wish that I didn't have to think about everything, that I could have gotten off the phone with my mom and at least ran out to my car unprepared for a trip home, no clothes, no toothbrush, no gas.

It is important to give back to the community.  Just this past Thanksgiving my father and son and I packed dinners for people that couldn't afford to buy their own or were unable to go out to the store and get them. My father did things like this all the time when I was growing up, and for as long as I can remember he brought me with him.  He always wore a red hat with white snowflakes everytime. I think he still has the hat in a closet somewhere.
As a young child, I loved going. It felt good just to be helping out, even though at the time I didn't really understand the nature of what we were doing. At eight years old I was simply unable to comprehend the fact that there were families who couldn't afford a Thanksgiving dinner. I just enjoyed spending time with my parents and feeling like part of a team. In my turbulent teen years it was always a battle to force me to go, but as I matured and reached adulthood, I learned to appreciate it on a new, deeper level.  It actually made me feel good. Every time I left after volunteering, I felt better than I did going in. I left with a sense of accomplishment. I made a difference.
I believe in volunteering. I believe in charity in general, but since I've never been able to afford to contribute to charities financially, I donated what I could: time. Not that it hasn't been difficult to find time! As a single working mother, and a student to boot, free time is not something that I am well acquainted with.  I think people sometime get caught up in their own lives they forget how easy it is to give an hour to help another person out.  It may not be every day or even week or month, but I make sure that I do volunteer work several times a year.
I continue to go with my father every Thanksgiving to pack the dinners for those who can't afford them. It's something that we've always been able to share, and something that I pray we will be able to share in the future. I'm grateful to him for introducing me to the joy of volunteer work, and I look forward to sharing this gift with my son as well. 
This was the first Thanksgiving that I brought my son with my father and me for our Thanksgiving tradition. I see in him the same joy I felt at his age. Just feeling good to be helping out the grown-ups, and feeling like part of a team. If I'm a model to go by, I dread his teenage years, but I will make him come with me still. I hope that as he matures he will find the joy and the greater meaning that I have discovered through volunteering.

Going up as I was little not having not parents around it 
Was very hard for me. I Use to live with my grandma.
She always told me you have to earn respect I really didn't
Know what that mean but as I got older I start founding 
Out what that meant. And what it mean was that. You
Must treat people the way you wanted to be treated.
Never treat anyone different no matter what. She always 
Said to be the king of the jungle. To be bigger and better
Why I'm here
As I was growing up. I was one of the baddest kids out 
There, getting in trouble, yelling at my elders, talking
Back, being disrespectful. No one never really taught me 
The rules in life. There was this one time when my friend
Tray drop me at the hospital to see my aunt. Now at the 
Time I really didn't believe in god because of the things
That was going on in my life. Thing always wonder in my 
Mind. One of the main question that I wonder was why 
Was I here the day that I got stranded. I started to walk 
In the big city. Looking at buildings, cars and people 
Walking. I finally find out the reason why Caleb X White
Is here to serve and protect and make money.
Mistakes
The mistakes that I learn in my that I had to found out in 
My life was hard. There was a time when someone back 
Stab me. There was a time when I thought everybody was 
My friend. Intel I jump. After that I new I had to choose
My friends wisely and be careful who I hang out with.
Being responsible
In 2003 I move to Albuquerque NM I had to move to 
NM to get a better education. My aunt was nice. I could 
Just do anything I want. But as the years pass. It was time
For me to take responsibility. My aunt toad me each time
Each time I got older the world will become yours. What
That means. Is that this is your world you have the right 
Choice in your life.
Right thing
I just want to say that make right choices in your life.
I promise if you do the right things. Good thins would 
Happen to you. If you do bad things bad things would 
Happen to you. Be thankful you r here.

037345.txt,Katie,,Under 18,"Santa Rosa, California","December 11, 2007",2007,This I Believe,nature,"Since I was a little kid, my favorite thing to do has been to look at the stars and think about life. I loved and still love the feeling of irrelevance that looking at the greatness of the universe in which I live gives me. When ever in my life I needed to think by myself or clear my head the best place to go has been my backyard at nighttime. I believe in the nighttime, in the quietness, in life questions and most of all in the stars. It seems like the stars are the only things there against the black nothingness of the sky that I will never understand. It makes me feel so small and so great at the same time to be a living part of this extravagant place. 
The best place to star gaze is at my family's house in Sea Ranch. The fact that there are no street lights to block the view of the night sky makes it a perfect star gazing location. Sea ranch is by itself a beautiful relaxing place where nature is at it's best, the clean crisp ocean air, tall wild grass and flowers, and most of all the secluded unpopulated beaches.  I always look forward to the nighttime there where it is as quiet as it could be, night hikes and beach walks under the stars are two of my favorite activities while there as well as looking through a telescope to get a closer look. The beach has a captivating feeling to it, your senses get caught up in the moment when everything from the crashing waves, to the sand between your toes and the slight chill of wind giving you goose bumps, and the night sky and my mind full of wonder of how things can be so perfect and so confusing at the same time.  
	When I was younger, I would always stare at the same three stars, to this day I still know which ones they are. When I was little I used to sit and think about how someday I wanted to go to these stars.  Now that I'm older I can sit and think about how far these stars are away from me and how I will never reach them yet am still fascinated by them it is still very comforting to know that they've always been there for me to think under from when my first dog died to my first break up, the stars always just stand out more to me then the other ones, and they hold a lot of memories. 
One of my favorite conversations I had with my sister was under the stars in Hawaii late at night on the beach. Though we were far from my back yard the three stars were still sitting there blinking. We talked about how strange yet entertaining our family is.  We talked about life and the people that were important to us.  About how the world is so big to us because we don't know a lot of the world, but it is so small in span of everything else, that why should it matter. I believe that stars bring a sense of wonder out in people. They make people want to question their significance. But most of all I believe that stars are proof of the fact that there is so much else out there, and it is important to remember that when you get too caught up in what you think things should be like.

As a young child, I grew up on the morals of going to church every Sunday.
If you had the life style that I grew up with, you would be a happy person. 
I have loving parents that care about me and always want the best for me.
As I grew up in the church life style, you see many things and hear stories 
of great healing and miraculous miracles.
As a young child, I didn't believe so much of everything that was happening around the church and inside.
Around the age of nine or ten, I realized that I had a hard time of hearing everything around me. My mother brought me to the doctor to figure out what was wrong and they told us that I would have to get tubes in my ears to make everything seem normal. They said that it would fix all the ear infections that I was having. 
After the procedure was over, I was given the chance to hear everything a lot more clearly than before.
About a month or two after the procedure, my right eat began to give me an unhappy discomfort, so I asked my mom to take me to the doctor to get it checked. 
It was found that my tube fell out from my right ear and that the tube left a little hole inside my ear. The doctor told me that he could put a little patch over my ear to help get rid of the hole, but it is not definite that it would heal.
The next day when we went to church, my mom asked the church pray for me about my ear and that everything would be back to normal. 
A week later, we returned to the doctor to find that the hole is my ear was completely healed. My mom praised the lord right in the office and I was very happy to hear the news that the doctor told us. 
We went home to tell all my relatives and my family that my ear has healed and that everything was ok.
I am now eighteen and my hearing is as good as new. I thank the Lord for all his blessings and thank him for how he blessed my ear to have it healed.
After the incident with my ear, I always believe that there are miracles all around us and that they can happen to anyone believes in them.

037563.txt,Vickey,,50 - 65,"worland, Wyoming","December 12, 2007",2007,This I Believe,faith & religion,"I Believe
I Believe that God is Creator and Maintainer of all things from the biggest, you know like universes, black holes, quasars, and that strange dark matter, all the way down to the smallest in the sub-atomic world of quantum mechanics, you know like protons, electrons, neutrons, even quarks!
I believe this same God has orchestrated so many extraordinary events in my life that they have become quite ordinary. Listen now as I share my soul:  I believe that on a cold November night in Wyoming He heard the cry of a small feral kitten and brought into play the circumstances to save it. I Believe as I pulled my hay cart into the field to feed my horses on that cold dark winter night He was there. I believe He timed it so I would be in that place, at that time. I believe He encouraged me as I followed the sound of that desperate ""meow"" through a kosher weed packed field only to realize this task could not be successful without light!   I believe it was He who reminded me that somewhere in my car many years ago I had a flashlight. Well anyone with a ranch vehicle will testify that only with Divine intervention can one find something that you haven't seen or used for years!  I believe he did indeed help me find it, but after many long Wyoming winters surely the batteries were dead. Well I believe the same God that spoke light into being with three words caused that old flashlight to burn brightly that night! I believe He helped me find that kitten huddled down in the middle of a thick patch of weeds. I believe He held that feral kitten in place so that my human hand could reach out and pick it up and tuck it down in my coveralls. I believe He kept it calm while I finished my chores. And I believe He laughed when I turned it loose in my bathroom and I realized just how wild it was as I watched it literally climb my walls!
    I believe He sustained the life of a small premature foal, born on a cold winter night to a mare I rescued that was starving to death. Born premature, malnourished, with a severe clef pallet and pneumonia, that homely little foal not only survived but flourished! We named him Promise! And I believe four years later when I took Promise to the vet to be cut the Creator sustained him again. I believe it was He who put an itch in the mind of the vet as he started to leave on a country call to go back and check Promise; he found him standing in his own bowels covered in sheep poop! I believe the Creator smiled when the vet told us the ominous news that the only horse he had ever heard of surviving through such an ordeal was one that had dropped his bowels on a sterile operating floor, for Promise woke up hungry and never even cracked a fever! 
  Well truly I could go on and on. For my life of Belief has been filled with the extraordinary, I live in the constant wake of His passing by. A world filled with wonder where the impossible is the most likely outcome.
   Many may be asking, ""What about real miracles"", you know like the parting of the Red Sea! Oh believe me when I say those too have graced my life so amazingly often. But it is His intervention in the small things that amazes me the most. I serve Him because of His Majesty and Power. But it is because He hears the cry of a feral kitten, and the wheezing of a sickly foal that reaches into my very being and touches me in an ineffable way. For He who is Perfect desires the companionship of that which is imperfect, He who is Most Beautiful desires the companionship of that which is ugly, He who is All Powerful desires the companionship of that which is weak, He who is Eternal desires the companionship of that which is so ephemeral. What many term unwanted, unnecessary, even a nuisance He declares with His Divine intervention to be of Great Worth! It is because of this revelation of His True Character that endears me to Him the most.  I serve Him because of His Power and Majesty but I love Him because of His Compassion.
  Now I realize many may ""not"" believe the Creator would bother Himself with some silly animal. Many of these panjandrums even say they serve this same All Mighty Creator. But to those I am also grateful for they have given me the ""title"" of my musings. For: ""I Believe that which most do not!""

I believe that confidence is success.
I lost a lot of confidence in my abilities during my senior year of high school.
Many things factored in to my loss of confidence such as:
Not getting the part I wanted in the school musical.
College auditions.
The intimidation factor of leaving home in a year.
I had such a successful junior year in the music department at my high school.
I had a dance solo in the fall of my junior year, a solo in the winter concert, and a big part in the musical.
So when my senior year came around I expected the same or better.
I did not end up with the same or better though.
In fact, I felt that in the music department my senior year the only thing I had going for me was my leadership skills—acting as a role model for the underclassmen.
Then of course I had a ton of college auditions.
Most of them made me lose confidence in myself because:
1.	There were so many amazing singers/dancers/actors.
2.	I had been told at my Millikin audition that my acting needed major improvement.
So these things only brought down my self-esteem even more.
Don't get me wrong, I had an awesome senior year, just not that senior year I had expected or hoped for.
The summer before arriving at college I knew I needed to make some changes in my life style if I wanted to be successful.
The first change that needed to be made was the confidence I had with myself.
I told myself I would arrive at school confident with who I was and confident with my abilities.
I knew that if I was not confident when I arrived at Millikin my nerves and low self-esteem would get the best of me and I would be unhappy.
There was NO WAY I was going to have a unhappy college career and I learned in high school that being happy is something that comes at the start.
I arrived at school knowing that I was a talented singer and dancer.
Also, knowing that my acting needed improvement, but after all isn't that why I was going to school for theatre?
If I didn't need improvement I wouldn't be at school.
The confidence I brought to school  (and hard work) definitely paid off.
I was really confident in my Unified Audition, but expected nothing out of it since I'm only a freshman.
I ended up getting called back for a part in the musical and that made me feel a lot better about myself.
Since I have been at school I have learned to be confident with myself.
I have improved my acting abilities with confidence and education.
I will continue to improve all of my skills here at Millikin.
And so, I believe confidence is success.

037837.txt,Christopher,,Under 18,"Winfield, Illinois","December 14, 2007",2007,This I Believe,integrity,"Doing the Right Thing
I believe in doing the right thing. I have been crossed many times with the question of do what is right or do what will be the least amount of work. Lots of time at school I go for the least amount of work. When I am working for my grandparents at our family store or even at there house I always do the right thing. It could be something as small as a washer to hold the handle of the lawnmower to the engine, or to fixing a light pole my grandpa backed into. I have never asked them to pay me for the work I do at there house. There has been very few times that my grandma hasn't given me something. She is a very stubborn lady and would never have me do something and then not pay me for it. In that light I put aside money every time I get it from her and by Christmas I have a nice chunk of cash to get them a very nice gift. I think that is the right thing to do. 
I believe in doing the right thing but some times I don't do what is right. I've been to parties, been late to curfew, and cut class a few times. I have never really gotten anything from those things except for the fear of being caught. It not a good thing necessarily but I did learn that if you get caught at twelve in the morning you better just come out and tell the truth. First of all there is no way to doge it. Second, there going to get the truth it all just a matter of time.
But anyways back to the right thing to do. If I'm walking down the street and I see a twenty dollar bill I look around and put it right in my wallet. With out even a second thought. I could have asked if it was anyone's or donate it to some sort of fund raiser. But I could also go out to lunch and not spend any money I worked for. This actually happened to me one day a few years ago. I ended up spending some of the money on a Gatorade. I felt sort of bad that I did that and the next week at church I gave the rest to the collection basket.
Doing the right thing in my mind is never an easy thing to do. Why help someone before you can help yourself? In my mind I will always do what is right in the long run.

	With all of the chaos and mayhem in this world, when it's all said and done, at the end of the day you only have yourself. No one else is going to be there to hold your hand and walk you down the beaten path when things get rough, which is why, above all else, I believe in myself. Now this has no dictionary definition, in fact everyone's definition may be different. But to me, believing in myself means that I am able to do anything I put my mind to; that I will never let myself down, that I am my biggest supporter, and that I will make it through any obstacle life throws my way.
	Growing up, it seemed like I was living in the shadow of my older sister. She was ""the smart one"", earning straight ""A's"", and graduating from high school a year early. Her accomplishments set the bar pretty high, and were impossible for me to compete with. I was always the mediocre child whom no one ever seemed to believe in. My sister was always the main focal point in all situations. My parents pushed her to do her best and she never seemed to let them down. From my sister, my parents accepted no less that a ""B."" When it came to me however, they were pleased with a ""C"", and ""A's"" took them by surprise. I would try my hardest, but my hardest was never good enough. I remember when I came home from school in seventh grade with straight ""A's"" for the semester and a gigantic smile on my face, my dad immediately went back to the school to make sure it was correct because he thought I had somehow forged it. Having that initial doubt from him made everything I worked so hard for feel worthless.
	My parents always seemed to unintentionally push me away. My mom was constantly out of town for extended periods of time for business, and my dad always seemed to be busy as well. I was given a lot of freedom, and through the freedom I grew up quickly. I learned to do many things for myself only because no one else was there to do them for me. By the time I was 11 years old, I was packing my own lunch for school, and making my own dinner at night. I was doing my own laundry and even cleaning the house every other weekend. 
When I was 13, my parents decided to go to New Orleans for two weeks for their anniversary. I was left home all alone with 60 dollars and a half empty refrigerator. I was left to cook for myself and told to use the money only if there was an emergency. I would come home from school, do my homework, watch a little television, make myself dinner, and go to sleep at a decent hour so that I could wake up at five o'clock in the morning to get ready and catch the bus for school. My parents would only call every other day to check in on me and make sure everything was okay. These phone conversations only lasted 20 minutes max.
I was raised to have an open mind, question everything, and do what I believed was right, not necessarily what everyone else was doing. Most importantly I was encouraged to do whatever makes me happy. I took what I had been taught for so long and began to really think about it and apply it to my life, making my junior year of high school a huge turning point. This is when I finally found happiness. 
November 14th, 2005 is a day I will never forget. It was the day my mother confronted me about my sexuality.  I had been in a relationship for three months prior, but it wasn't until that day that she decided to ask about it. I stood in front of her, staring straight into her eyes, dumbfounded, speechless. I had no idea how to react, much less what to say. I confirmed it with a simple nod, and walked straight to my bathroom where I proceeded to cry for the next hour on my shower floor. When I finally gathered enough will-power to get up, I was greeted at the bathroom door with yelling and screaming from both parents, my mother especially. ""What did I ever do to you to deserve this"", ""What did I do wrong"", ""This better just be a phase"" were the three things she kept repeating over and over again, my father stood there shaking his head in the background. I had no one to turn to, no shoulder to cry on. I was all alone during a time where I felt most vulnerable.  I had only myself once again.
 Coming out is probably one of the hardest things to do, and having the majority of your family and a large fraction of your friends turn their backs on you does not make it much easier; it's devastating. There were countless tear-filled nights of solitude, but like the design of a yin yang shows us, you have to travel through the darkness to reach the light. I felt as though I was no longer dependent upon anyone. I had only myself, and for the first time I was fully okay with that. During this time, I learned my self-worth, my pride, and like I said before, I learned what true happiness was. This period of time was the most stressful yet exhilarating time of my life.
	I do what I want; I do not let society shape me. I stand up for what I, Lauren Hayes, believe in, which is the most satisfying feeling and nobody can take that away from me. This is exactly why I believe in myself.

I believe that life isn't fair, because nobody goes through life with out having any struggles at all, but that shouldn't get us down.  Everybody makes mistakes, or spills their coffee on their way to work, or is late to school and gets chewed out, but that's how life is.  We all just want to go through life and have it be really easy, but that is not going to happen.  We need to realize that going through life with no difficulties is just unrealistic, because bad news or an embarrassing fall or any thing for that matter, is going to come up, but we just have to go through and be strong about it.  This topic also fits in with stereotyping.  For example, someone who has less money than another person is probably going to stereotype the wealthier person by how much money they have and that their life is so perfect and easy, but it's really not.  The person with the more money is most likely to have it harder, because they earn and work really hard for that money in which they benefit.  They went through the tough times strongly and very wisely by not letting the hard times get to them, they just kept going forward in what they believed in, even though it wasn't the easiest, they still did it.  And the people stereotype them really shouldn't, because they are self hero's, because they didn't let the hard times, in life get to them.  So we should all look up to people like that, and do the things we want to accomplish, even though life can be really difficult at some times, just realize life isn't always fair, but that shouldn't get you down and stop you from pursuing, accomplishing, and succeeding your dreams.  So I believe that life isn't fair, but we can all accomplish what we want and all our goals if we just try.

I believe everyone should have an equal opportunity to a quality education.  Education is necessary in every aspect of life from having a day-to-day conversation to living life to the fullest. 
Without knowing how to read or having a descent vocabulary, talking to others would be extremely difficult.  If you think about it, starting in kindergarten, children are learning how to read and talk to their classmates.  If a child missed the opportunity to discover these first life skills, they would quickly fall behind everyone else and miss out on basically everything.  Having taken a few years of Spanish, I can relate to the difficulties one would encounter trying to communicate with someone without knowing their language. 
Education enables us to be aware of what is going on throughout our communities and in the world.  In order to be able to interpret events, one would have to answer such questions as: ""What happened?"" and ""Why did that happen?""  Through school we learn about local and world issues and the history behind them.  If a person lacked an education they would have no basis of knowledge allowing them to make sense of the world.  
In order to get by, a person must have a job.  Food and shelter are essential to life, and they are incredibly hard to obtain without money acquired through work.  Although there are jobs available that require minimal capabilities, even the simplest jobs require a small amount of education.  Numerous jobs involve math from the addition or subtraction of two numbers to the computing of force required to lift an aircraft.  Reading and writing are also vital to the survival of a person's job.  Without the education necessary to work, survival would be quite complicated.  What's more, a better education provides for a better job and allows a person to be all that they can be. 
Everyone should strive to be the utmost they can be.  There is a colossal amount of knowledge in the world, and further knowledge is discovered every day.  The children are the future, so in order to keep the United States as a major world power, they must have access to education.  Education is a force that allows everyone to live life to the fullest and to work toward new hopes and dreams.  Without education prevalent in society, where would humanity be headed?
In the end, nothing in life is free.  Even though the opportunity to learn is provided, it will require a level of commitment and dedication on ones behalf to excel.

038366.txt,Joshua,,18 - 30,"Provo, Utah","December 19, 2007",2007,This I Believe,education & knowledge,"Last year I went on an academic recruiting trip to BYU. While on the trip, I fell in love with the college campus, and I met three guys that would change my life forever. Over the next year we kept in contact as we counted down the days until our college years would begin. We all had our different reasons for striving so desperately to come to college. I, having moved all over the place, needed some stability in my life with a fresh new group of friends that I wouldn't leave after two years. There was Tyler who wanted to get out of the materialistic world of Southern California, filled with expensive cars and overpriced handbags. Then there was Sean who wanted to get away from a string of bad overdramatic high school relationships. Finally, there was Brett who wanted to get away from the town that he had lived in his entire life and come to a fresh place filled with new people. Whatever the reason or circumstance, one thing was clear, college is a time to start over. Entering college I was able to have a new slate where I could create a whole new image of myself. No one knew how I cheated on my girlfriend sophomore year or how I peed my pants in the sixth grade. I could be whoever I wanted to be because nobody knew who I once was. 
As the four of us entered college we were shocked at the new freedoms we had. There was no curfew obsessed parents, no unnaturally strict teachers, or no unbearable high school drama. We enthusiastically used this freedom to meet new people as these new people were enthused to meet us. I gained friendships nearly instantly as I roamed through the campus feeling a sense of freedom I thought I could never feel. 
College has given me an opportunity to serve. With this new structure of friends in my life, I finally have the opportunity to help those that were not as outgoing and do not have such a great social life. I have been able to constantly look and seek out these people, as I want them to have the college experience I have so happily enjoyed. Therefore, through having the chances to make others happy, I too have been filled with undying happiness.
After one semester of college, the original guys from that first recruiting trip and I are extremely close. We, however, have added hundreds of other friends to this close friendship in this seemingly never ending recruiting trip for happiness called college.
I believe in College.

When I was a little girl in New York city riding the bus with my mother, she taught me two important lessons, to give up my seat to someone older than me, which was just about everybody, and to say thank you to the bus driver.
Forty years later, I still thank every bus driver, and am amazed at how many riders don't.  I thank drivers who stop to let me cross streets.  I thank my kids when they take the garbage out.  I say thank you to waiters and waitresses, to sales clerks, to teachers.  I try to remember to thank my husband for taking the dogs out and changing light bulbs.
I write thank you notes to just about everyone, whether I thanked them in person or not, for presents they gave me and kind acts they performed.   
When I got married, a friend of my mother-in-law's asked if we had received her present because she hadn't heard from us.  My shocked mother-in-law said, ""Morgan is so good about thank you notes, I can't imagine what happened."" I hadn't received the gift. It was lost in shipping.  It now hangs in our house, and the sender received a note.
It's more than common courtesy to say thank you.  It shows you care, that you appreciate the act performed for your benefit or the gift given you.  When I receive a note in the mail, via email or a verbal thank you for something I did, I feel valued and respected.  I didn't give the gift, throw the party or teach the class to be thanked, but to know the recipients took the time to write means they care and didn't just take what I did for granted.  I love hearing my kids say thank you when I do their laundry, although I don't hear it enough.  And, if a student says thank you, I know I've done a good job, just like the bus driver.
During the year my mother was dying, several close friends stood by me.  Six months after her death, I wanted to thank them for their support and have fun doing so.  I took them to a makeover party.  We chuckled as professional make up artists did our faces and then went out for drinks.  
My teenage daughters roll their eyes when I ask them to write their thank you notes but they reluctantly do so, on stationery with their names or pretty pictures on it.
But, I don't have to tell them to say thank you when they ride a bus or cross the street.  When I hear them thank the drivers, I know I've not only taught them to appreciate the things other people do for them, but to acknowledge them as well.

038776.txt,Elizabeth,,Under 18,"salt lake city, Utah","January 6, 2008",2008,This I Believe,self-knowledge,"I believe in dancing, the moment when I leave the harsh reality and become one with the music. Dancing is a way I can express my emotions and channel them into art. Dance is like a painting there are colors, emotions, and a purpose for painting it. The purpose of dance can be anything from a famous ballet to dancing by yourself in your room. The purpose itself doesn't matter as much as the feeling behind it.
       When I focus on the music and the movement I leave this world and enter the world where sound has color, movement has taste, and the sky is the limit. Dance can take and manipulate my emotions into something new. If am angry about something, after just a few minutes of dancing I forget all about my anger.
       When I was little I was the total opposite of a dancer. My sister on the other hand was an amazing dancer. She always wanted me to get out of soccer, volleyball, or any other sport. Before I thought that dance was silly and had nothing to do with competition, endurance, or anything else that had to do with the sports I loved. Try as she did I refused to go to a dance class with her. 
       My sister finally bullied me into taking a class with her. After that one class I found out that it was harder then it looked. Though I was wrong I still didn't want go to any other dance classes. After all of the sports were done I decided to go to another dance class with my sister. After a few weeks of dancing I was hooked, I have been dancing for three years now.  I believe in dancing and how it took me by surprise.

They sacrifice their time and energy, to support the family, and guide their children. Without the daily sacrifices parents give, many of our lives would be much different.
        Before, I had always thought that my parents didn't care about me. Always distant. It was almost as if they only cared about their job, my education, and not my enjoyment of life or even their own enjoyment. Throughout my life, I've always had meals set on the table before me, extracurricular activities signed up for, and paid for, and all the other essentials. I took all these things for granted; not realizing all the effort and work that it takes to make these basics happen. Not really appreciating them, for what they were doing. 
	However after watching the movie, ""The Pursuit of Happyness"", I've realized exactly how hard it actually is to continually put food on the dinner table, and have a place to sleep. It was then I realized how much my parents sacrifice to pay our bills, and support the family. And it's not just my parents, but also everybody else's as well. 
	In the movie, Chris Gardner is man desperately trying to find a place in life for him and his son. He sacrifices many things, so he could get an internship so he could finally have a job to support a family. In some parts, his son and him, sleep in a subway or a community shelter for the homeless, for lack of a better place to stay. He even lies to his son, and pretends that sleeping in these bad conditions is all a game, so his son wouldn't worry.
	Like Chris Gardner, my parents also sacrifice much. They go to work everyday, early in the morning, after sending me to school. At work, things aren't tranquil or easy. They have to stress about work meetings, and projects that need to be finished and other related things. Then they come back home, with a laptop, and continue to work hard, and only stopping to cook and eat dinner. They seldom do things they enjoy until it's late at night, or on holidays. All of the things they enjoy are in arm reach of them had they not been so busy, yet they continue to sacrifice out of love of the family, and kindness. 
	Even though most teenagers consider themselves independent, and able to get through life without their parents, in reality, they would be completely lost. In the end, parents show their greatest love and kindness for you by sacrificing. Ultimately, the more they sacrifice, the more they care, and vice versa.

	""For me, it might sound cliché, but beauty for me really does start on the inside.  It's like a state of mind, a state of love if you will.  Then, whatever you can do on the outside is all like a bonus.""  This quote was said by Queen Latifah and represents how beauty is physical and does not show who a true person really is.  	
	Each day is a new day, which means there is always room for improvement.  I try to live life to the fullest, and I have learned through many experiences to never judge.  It is funny, yet sad, how often people are quick to judge others without knowing anything about that person or where they come from.  Being judgmental is only one of the many negative qualities exposed in our society; it only takes one person at a time to make a difference and with this, our world can become better each day.  I have been guilty of using wrong judgments and have tried to better myself as a person by putting differences aside.
	A great motto to live is ""Beauty is only skin deep,"" and knowing that physical beauty is superficial and is not as important as a person's intellectual, emotional, and spiritual qualities.  In today's world, people depend upon what the eye sees much more than a person's soul and mind.  Although some people one might meet in one's lifetime appear to be standoffish, for one to take the time to get to know that person makes all the difference.  I have experienced this a few times recently and it has taught me to be open and accepting.  I feel as if forgiveness is one of God's greatest gift and we, as human, take the emotions of disappointment, resentment, and anger for granted sometimes.  
	I was always taught to look past a person's physical features and reflect upon this as  one of the most valuable lessons to learn in life.  Queen Latifah is a great example of a person who is accepting of her own natural beauty by displaying positive and humorous traits through the things she was blesses with.  Beauty is only skin deep.  This I believe.

	I believe that Global Warming has become a huge problem and that we need to do something to fix it. Why? You ask, well, remember how much fun it was to be able to go to the zoo and see all the animals? Of course you do, remember how all the animals there were free and didn't have a care in the world?  Well, not to burst your bubble or anything, but that has changed! 
Global Warming is ruining Arctic animal's habitats. It really might not seem like a lot right now, but just you wait! I believe this is becoming a problem, because it's killing innocent animals when it's MAINLY our fault! Don't you care about our solar system and ecosystem? If you do, you'd take time and care in trying to stop this horrible thing that is going on in this world.
How would you like it if someone came into your house, ransacked the place and didn't clean it up, and it stayed like that for a VERY long time? Well, that's how Polar Bears and many other animals are feeling right now. The heat from the Warming is disturbing animals habitats/ homes. Try having to live in a messy room (unless you already have one) for 2 years then you'll know how they feel.  It's a matter of life and death here, and people are just going on with their natural life and not doing anything about it!
Every day, more and more Polar Bears die, and more obvious it becomes that they're becoming extinct! Now, I'm sure no one REALLY cares about DO – DO birds, but Polar Bears are a specific species that we all know and love. Correct? After focusing on this topic for a while, I realized that we are hurting more than we think we are. We are making people and animals suffer for what we've done. Even though some people care, it still ticks me off that people have the power and ability to do something, but are so lackadaisical that they won't do anything!
I think that one way we could change this is to try to switch cars to be solar powered or for cars just not to hold much gas. The human mind it a great thing, and I believe that we can make and difference and change this horrific problem. I believe that Global Warming has become a problem, and we need to take just a little bit of time out of our day to fix it! Trust me, one day, you'll thank yourself!

040118.txt,Jeanne,,30 - 50,"Pinedale, Wyoming","February 4, 2008",2008,This I Believe,change;self-knowledge,"Growing up, I was a cautious child. I never entered a new situation easily, and when I did, I preferred to be an observer rather than an actor.  The comfortable confines of what was known was where I wanted to stay. You see, I liked to succeed. And success, of course, meant doing it perfectly.
There came a point in my life when I realized that my caution was limiting my experience, and so I began to ""dare"" myself. I dared myself to try out for a play. I dared myself to sing a solo. I dared myself to go to Spain and live with family for a year. Every one of these ""dares"" made me almost physically ill. I would enter these situations  with knee-knocking, heart pounding, nauseating fear, but by and large, I was ""successful"" at them. I became a much more courageous person, but my definition of success had not changed. 
After graduating from college, I presented myself with my ultimate dare. I joined the Peace Corps. Typical of an early twenties young adult, I had that feeling of invincibility and security in the thought that I had all the answers. I had visions of ""saving the world"", bringing my great wisdom to the poor souls of Africa. I would be some poor village's shining light. I was the walking embodiment of first world Caucasian conceit. Disembarking from the airplane, I often joke, we were required to hand over our passports and our rose-colored glasses. Reality, as it turns out, was a far harsher teacher than I had envisioned.
The village I lived in didn't want my presence, I was just a reminder of all of the other ""know it all"" white people who claimed to know better. My students didn't want my knowledge, they were just fine without me, thank you very much. What I did provide was a target—for generations of fear and anger of what white colonization had done to their people and their culture.  Was it fair? No, of course not. But how fairly did we treat the minorities in our own country? Suddenly, my image of the world, from the point of view of a comfortable middle class upbringing, where all was fair if you just worked hard enough, evaporated. Or should I say, shattered?
I crawled into a dark hole and dragged myself out every morning to my students' classroom and stumbled and fumbled my way through lesson after lesson, while students whispered and laughed and slept. God, I wanted to go home. This wasn't ""The toughest job I'd ever love.""  This was a nightmare—my worst. You see, I took a chance, and I failed.
Somewhere about half way through my tour of 2 years, I called my brother. I cried. I told him I hated it. I told him I wanted to come home. 
""Well, why don't you?"" he asked. I was speechless. What did he mean, why don't I?"" Where was the pep talk? Where was the ""You can do it, Jeanne!"" Where was the ""every thing will be all right""?
""I can't,"" I whispered, ""Everyone will say I couldn't make it. Everyone will think I'm a failure.""
""Jeanne,"" he said, ""Every one thinks of doing some thing like your doing now.  We see those commercials too, and think 'Wow, wouldn't that be cool,' but we didn't climb on an airplane and travel thousands of miles away from home to accept a teaching position.  What do you mean, you'll be a failure? Don't you realize the second you stepped off that plane in Africa, you were already a success? You were courageous enough to go there. None of us were. None of us even filled out an application.""
At that precise moment my whole definition of success and failure changed.  Success no longer means ""doing it right"" or ""being perfect"". Success means holding your breath and trying something new. Success means change. Success means learning the hard lessons. Failure is not taking that risk.  Making mistakes is no longer a huge fear in my life. Life goes on. My only fear now is that I'll get to the end of my life, and regret that I failed to try.

040200.txt,Mary Caroline,,Under 18,Houston,"February 5, 2008",2008,This I Believe,education & knowledge,"The Simple Life…Kindergarten 
	I believe in Kindergarten. It is so simple. Kindergarten. Everyone loved kindergarten. Why can't our whole lives stay just like our lives were in kindergarten? It is a known fact that children in kindergarten are much more emotionally stable then the children that never attended kindergarten.  If you never sent your children to kindergarten, then you should trust me and participate with your child in the activities carried out in a regular kindergarten class. 
I loved coming to school after eating an Eggo waffle with maple syrup. I loved wearing my new white Keds and new backpack. I loved my Power Puff Girl lunch box that contained my ""pb and j"" with the crust cut off. I loved being with all my new friends,  the bows in their hair and the fireman tennis shoes that light up when they walk. I loved sitting in my chair with my legs dangling off the edge eagerly waiting for my turn to play with the blocks or Play-doh. 
 I believe in kindergarten because in class we would read books about rabbits stealing vegetables from gardens and instead of books about sex and violence. In kindergarten we would watch movies about princesses going to balls or about talking toasters. We didn't watch movies about death and despair. 
I believe in kindergarten because that is where we learn the basics of life. We learn how to share, we lean how to be nice to others, we learn not talk to strangers, we learn that taking naps everyday is very important, we learn personal hygiene, we learn to tie our shoes, we learn to paint, (well finger paint), and we learn that cookies and milk with your mom can make any pain go away.
 I believe in kindergarten because of recess. At recess in kindergarten we played with bugs or climbed trees, played the game house, or colored. Adults and adolescents do not take the time to climb trees or color. They discuss business or stress over a test. The only thing that you stress about in kindergarten is how to whistle or snap your fingers. 
I believe in living in a world where the only thing that you stress about is snapping your fingers and whistling. In kindergarten you are unaware of all the bad and evil things in the world. You have nothing bad in your mind. You are innocent and pure. If everyone lived like they were in kindergarten life would be more carefree and easy.

First, about me.  I am not a professional pundit, writer or even a politician.  I have been blessed with the ability to see life in a very long term perspective.  I am simply a visionary American, living in a new era, and I believe that our country is having a terrible crisis.
Our country has gone through many different political and social upheavals in the past  fifty years.  Politically, socially, economically and culturally, we are not the same country we were in the Nineteen Fifties.  The enemies, economies, villains and even our national goals have changed.
Many of these changes have contributed to this crisis, and must be repaired before we can successfully continue our democracy.  We must save our society, by addressing many of the problems we have given ourselves.
I believe very strongly that everything is inter-connected.  Because fixing one problem will break another one, unless we do them ALL at ONCE, we will have a great deal of trouble getting them all fixed.
Because of this, I believe that our country again needs a visionary solution to many of these problems at once, in a way that was once successfully used by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  I am of course proposing a new, ""NEW DEAL"".
This time our new deal will need to address some different and some similar problems to the time when FDR introduced his New deal.  Then he had to deal with a terrible horrific lingering recession (later renamed a depression), banking, communications, and other general problems. 
Now we need to fix issues like Poverty, Education, Health Care, Youth Training, Rebuilding our country's infrastructure, and reforming our political system.
Hey.  I said it would resolve the issues; I didn't say it would be very easy.
We could start with the new concept of a ""living wage"", which would allow a worker to actually make enough money to raise a family.  We would continue, with day care and education, follow through with Nationalized Health insurance for all, and then solve problems that we have with our economy, our infrastructure, and the terrible under-employment rate in our country.
Since first having come up with this principle  in the past year, I have watched our economic, infrastructure and employment problems increase from possible problems, to huge albatrosses around the neck of our country. 
I believe that saving our society is desirable.  That's why we need to solve all of these problems at the same time.  I hope you will agree, and join me in this effort to save our society and create a new deal.

040898.txt,Anna,,Under 18,"LaGrange, Illinois","February 18, 2008",2008,Laughter is Best,humor & laughter,"I believe that happiness and laughter can cure even the worst situations.  Our family had received a call at 5 a.m. a few days after Thanksgiving in 2001; I was in the fourth grade.  The call told us that my grandfather was in the hospital for a blood infection, and it was predicted that he wouldn't make it.  We packed the car knowing this would be the last time we would ever see him.  My sister, who was 13 at the time, and I sat in the back of our minivan playing Nintendo for four hours straight as we drove to Springfield, Illinois.  We had no idea what was really happening.  I had already lost many extended family members when I was little, and it was almost like my brain was programmed to forget about reality and drift off.  
	The car pulled into St. Joseph hospital.  My dad turned off the engine, and I prepared him to give me a speech.  He turned around, gave a smile, and told us that he might die today… but no matter what my grandfather loved us and would never want us to be sad.  
	My step-grandma Nigel met us at the entrance of the hospital room.  She gave me a great big hug and told my sister and me to wait inside the room with my grandpa.
	Inside the room, my grandpa told my sister and me how much he loved us and how proud of us he was.  As, my mother and father entered, he repeated somewhat of the same words.  He then asked why we were all here.  Was this his death bed?    My mom responded, ""Oh we just came down here to get that soup you told us about… the tomato.""  I will remember for the rest of my life these next words.  My grandpa chuckled a little and said, ""Whatever you do in your life, just make sure you never get their broccoli soup!""
	Our family laughed hysterically, and my grandfather drifted asleep.  He never awoke, but my whole life I've lived with that memory.  Not the memory that my grandfather died, but the memory that we were all together in one room just laughing.  I try to live my life like that:  laugh a little even when things get tough.  A terrible situation can become happy if some just makes a joke.  I know now that the cure to life, my life is laughing.

more conveniences, but less time.
We have more degrees but less sense;
more knowledge but less judgment;
more experts, but more problems;
more medicines but less healthiness.
We've been all the way to the moon and back,
but have trouble in crossing the street to meet our new neighbor.
We built more computers to hold more copies than ever,
But have less real communication;
We have become long on quantity,
but short on quality.
These are times of fast foods but slow digestion;
Tall mean but short characters;
Steep profits but shallow relationships.
It's a time when there is much in the window
But nothing in the room.
– His Holiness the XIVth Dalai Lama
	In our world, we invent new technology, cure more diseases, and improve the outside look of everyone. But as we improve our daily life, we cause more problems, in technology, health, or look. At times we waste our new found information, take many things for granted, or base people's ability to succeed based on their looks. I consider that every human being has weaknesses and strengths. Dalai Lama's passage about the paradox of our age, sadly, holds to be true. I feel that we should be able to overcome and show that we do have confidence in the inner spirit of someone instead of their looks, be able to meet new people, think of our health, and think more about what is made instead of how much. Money has become a great success and a great spoil of the world. It is appeared that money means everything, in appearing so, it destroys the youth's mind and focus and proves to be poison. Quality of relationships, life, and what makes you happy should be everything but in our present world that is put aside. Money is a poison because one must die in order to receive it's happiness. People, in order to gain money, must disregard relationships, neglect loved ones, and put their life into work and not into the real success. The real success in everyone needs to be, to have relationships and be happy. In order to be happy, we must find peace in each other and congratulate someone when they find peace, show that we care. Our world is also based on stereotypes, the outside look of someone instead of the inner spirit. Constantly people are put down for the color of their skin, or what religion they believe in. Even in America, land of the free and equality, people are given better opportunities because of the color of their race. Americans are given freedom of religion, which depressingly enough, but are made fun of or singled out by groups of people. America was made as a haven for people who were facing discrimination and persecution, but both can be found on our streets. All over the world, wars are fought over land and resources or by pure hatred for fellow man. In our future, the world needs to change it's morals from money to happiness, from land to peace, and from stereotypes to acceptance. This I believe.

041099.txt,Joseph,,65+,"Moon Township, Pennsylvania","February 22, 2008",2008,I Believe in Heaven,faith & religion;values & spirituality,"I believe in Heaven on Earth.
Recently there was a picture in our newspaper of Jews, who had been held captive in Iran, being released and allowed to go to Israel. Their relatives in Israel were waiting for them with open arms. One man just getting to see his son for the first time in 17 years exclaimed, ""I'm in heaven"".  I believe the man realized exactly where he was.
I am a 68 yr old Roman Catholic who was raised along with 9 siblings in a traditional  setting. We were taught our duties and responsibilities to one another, to others, our country, and most of all to our God. In performance of these duties, we were to love, honor, and obey. That was good training. We learned there are things that are good and other things that are bad. We could make lists. But then we found out that some things fall into the gray area. As I grew older the gray area filled in fast even taking things out of one or the other strictly defined areas. I grew tired of not being able to separate various thoughts, and actions into either good or bad. At some point I began to wonder if there was something more important. I had a feeling there was something more, something I was missing. I read books and kept my wonderings alive, but I did not find specific answers to satisfy what I wanted to believe in.
 Many years went by. I got married and we raised a son who then got married. He and his wife started a household of their own. Now I have a dog and in the early morning hours we walk together. Often it is dark, peaceful and quiet. It is a good time to collect your thoughts. The controversies in the news turn over in your mind. One was whether evolution or creationism should be taught in schools. I am not a teacher and do not work in the schools, so none of this is my business. Nevertheless I wondered. While in these thoughts I believe an inspiration came to me. I started by thinking what the two beliefs said about the beginning. The evolutionists said that in the beginning there was a big bang and matter was flung out at high speed. The creationists said there was chaos. I thought maybe they were describing the same thing. So I kept on thinking. The creationists said that humankind was placed in the Garden of Eden where God provided for all their needs. Eventually the pair disobeyed God and they were thrown out of the Garden. I wondered how this would conform to evolutionary thought. Perhaps if the pair in the Bible were not a single pair but represented the entire species of humankind, the story would be a natural development. As the human brain developed the species would learn to depend on their knowledge more and less on God. Eventually they would be able to plan and finally to even disobey God. This would automatically cast them out of the garden and since they no longer depended on God to provide everything for them, they would have to go out and work for a living. Furthermore this original sin, this rational brain development, would be passed on to all following generations. We could never go back to the Garden. It was satisfying to me to find that different approaches would lead to the same results. I walked on in the dark with Rocco and kept on thinking about how things might come together.
One day I was standing at the bedside of a boyhood friend who was in a nursing home. He was going to receive Holy Communion. The deacon was reading some prayers to him. One phrase caught my attention, and afterwards, I asked the deacon where that came from. He said it was in the First Letter of John. I found that the phrase is there. It is simple and direct. ""God is Love"". I started to think like a scientist or mathematician about the enormous consequences of a statement that is simple, unequivocal and always true. Briefly it means that where there is love there is God. No exceptions are noted.  
According to many religions, heaven is a place where souls go when they leave their bodies. In heaven souls meet with those of family and friends and wait to greet more members with ecstatic joy. This is according to traditional belief. I believe this and I also go further. For I believe we sometimes experience Heaven on earth. I believe in Heaven all souls will be united in perfect love and intimacy. We wonder but cannot grasp what that might be like, but even here on earth we sometimes get a preview if only for a brief moment. Heaven is where God is. God is unconditional Love. When love is unconditional, we are in the presence of God. We are in heaven.
I have experienced this for fleeting moments. A little over a year ago my youngest granddaughter, 1and1/2 years old, was very tired after a long day. She was fussing and crying. She was too tired to be satisfied with any of the usual things that were offered. She just kept crying. I picked her up and walked out in the street where no one was around. I carried her close to me and told her that she was a good girl. She accepted my strength and my blessing and laid her body on my chest and totally relaxed. We were together in person and in spirit. I loved her and she placed all of her trust in me. In that moment our souls touched, and there was as there is in Heaven a moment of unconditional love. I believe that I was in Heaven on earth, and not just as a figure of speech. I believe I was actually in a state of Heaven.
In chemistry we learn that inanimate particles that are far away from each other have little or no affect on each other. There is no potential energy in the system. As they are pushed closer the energy stays near zero. However, when pushed very close together there begins a repulsive interaction. It's as though they feel that the other is getting in their space. If pushed closer the repulsive interaction increases. However there comes a point when the interaction changes and an attractive force pulls the particles together. It is only then that a chemical reaction can occur. Atoms and molecules bump into each other billions of times. Almost always the energy in the collision is transferred into a repulsive force and the atoms fly away from each other unchanged. Human social behavior is like that of atoms. Most of the time, we experience barriers and do not get close enough to feel the possible soul-to-soul attraction. On rare occasions we do, and then we feel a force greater than ourselves. I believe that force can pull us into Heaven.
I write this essay to say that on rare occasions I have experienced the force and completeness of uncomplicated love. I believe others have had experiences like this also. It took me nearly a lifetime and an inspiration from heaven to realize that God was very close and I was truly in heaven. Gravity holds the whole universe together. And I believe that God is Love, and Love holds all living things in heaven and on earth together. When we experience that love which is pure and uncomplicated then I believe we experience heaven on earth.

041333.txt,Stephanie,,18 - 30,"Cohutta, Georgia","February 27, 2008",2008,Love,love,"I believe in love.  I believe that love is being happy with someone no matter what the circumstances are.  I believe in being lost in the moment with the one you love.  True love does actually exist.  I also believe that love at first sight is a myth which is exaggerated by many people.  Marriage takes love.  A marriage cannot survive without love.  Love is complicated.  It is puzzling, confusing, stressing, it takes work and effort put forth to exist.
How do you know when you're in love?  Are you going to realize it when you fall in love?   Is love something that you go out and look for, or wait for it to come around your way?  Personal experiences have gave me the perception that love walks into your life unnoticed, and sweeps you off of your feet before you even realize what exactly it is. Love can make you laugh, it can make you cry, it can make you angry, it can make you sad.   Love can also be everything you ever wanted or needed in your life.
Does true love exist?  In my opinion, yes it does.  When you're true love walks into your life, you don't ever want them to leave it.  You cant eat, sleep, or  think, without them on your mind.  When you wake up in the middle of the night wishing they were by your side, wishing to hold them in your arms, and wishing this feeling is real, you have experienced love.   When all you can think about night and day is them, and when you would give anything to know they feel the same about you, you have experienced love.
Past relationships affect a persons overall perception of love.  Relationships mold a person to making their own belief of what love really is.  Love is something different for each and every person in this world.  There is no two meanings of the word love.  Romance can help the feeling get stronger.  It makes love grow even stronger inside your soul.  Love is good for you.  It can keep you healthy and happy, which a person needs.  
Everyone needs to feel what love is.  One time is all you need to become addicted to love.  It is an addiction which is very hard to break.  True love, love at first sight, romance, are all different in everyone's eyes.  It takes time to accept what love actually is.  It also takes time to find your own meaning of love, but when you do find it, it makes you realize and understand that it is not a bad thing to believe in.

	As my family and I traveled in our car to one of our favorite restaurants, kind of sarcastically, I said to my parents, ""Oh, were going to the car dealership, lets stop so I can pick out a car for my birthday present."" I knew it was a losing battle and probably never going to happen, so, I stopped asking after that. I figured it was worth a try. My Dad let out a short laugh and said,
 ""Marc, not in this life time? That's not going to happen in this life time, if you want your own car, you better start saving.""
In today's media filled society, many teens, including me, sometimes think we deserver things in life for no reason and should just have everything given to us. Even if this is what people can think, I respect my parents' decision for making me pay for myself because in the past, I've had to save my own money for things I wanted.  For instance, I saved a large amount of money for a guitar I wanted. It should last me my whole life if I take care of it. By spending my own money on it seems as though I take even more care and have more pride for my guitar. The first time I had heard the sound of it I had fallen in love and I knew it was the one. When I had gotten it I had to show it to everyone and couldn't stop playing it. This also shows me what happens when I work for something and finally seeing results. It also shows me what I can accomplish when I put my mind to something. This guitar taught me to take good care of things I buy myself because repairing it will come out of my pocket, instead of my parents. My dad still has his guitar from when he was my age that he had bought with his own money. 
My friends, my brother, and I went camping a while back. Now someone might think what does camping have to do with purchasing a vehicle, but this showed me that that anything I wanted I had to work for it myself. Being there with no adults we found out real quick what had to be done to survive this outing. For example, if no one new how to put up the tent or didn't put it up before dark, it could have caused some problems for us. Also, if we didn't collect enough wood for the night or couldn't get the fire stared we wouldn't not be able to eat and cook our food. When we gathered around the fire in the morning when the due was still on the grass and savored the freshly made sausages, eggs, and steaming hot coffee. We felt a sense of pride in our self and felt good that what we work for finally paid off. 
I know everyone wants a lucky break once in a while and we're all guilty of wanting it, but what I found out is that life can't be handed to you. And even if work is sometimes hard or the reward is far away, it teaches life long skills and makes us more responsible and appreciative in the materials we have. So if I ever what to get a car of my own, I better find a job soon, because that cherry red, low rider remote control impala that I got once, isn't going to get me to work everyday.

041671.txt,Alex,,Under 18,"Louisville, Kentucky","March 4, 2008",2008,Fate Can be Changed,self-knowledge,"I believe fate is comprised of a little of luck and a little of your choices.  Your actions can definitely change your fate.  One example would be the use of drugs.  This choice could put you in jail or strain your relationship with friends and family.  Another choice would be to work hard and get where you want in life.  A good work ethic is the building block for any major success in life.
	Luck also has a part in deciding your fate.  If you were unlucky enough to get robbed, your house burned down, or you contracted a serious disease, you would be completely miserable.  If you were able to win the lottery, then you would have all the money you would ever need.  But again, choosing how to spend this money can decide if you waste it all or save the money and invest it.
	I have made both good and bad choices and have had my share of lucky and unlucky occurrences.  One good choice I made was to enroll at my current high school, St. Xavier.  It is the best school in town and one of the best athletic schools in the country.  I have made many bad decisions, but none too serious. 
	Luck has also been a factor in my life experiences.  It was lucky I was chosen for a scholarship to St. Xavier.  I was also lucky in the fact most of my classmates are very funny and like to have fun, and all my teachers also like to have a good time.  I am unlucky enough to have a sister, but only sometimes does she really annoy me.  I am unlucky enough not to have won the lottery already or have won a foreign vacation for free.  I always try to keep my head up when luck turns against me, and I always come out on top anyway.  
Fate is more than just what life throws at you; it is making the right decisions to keep you on track to reaching your life goal.  So next time you are faced with a choice, big or small, just remember that you can change your fate by listening to your conscience and choosing the right option.

In the past year I've sprained my ankle twice and both times I was told to ""walk it off.""  The first time it was my friend, he didn't believe me that my ankle hurt.  The second time it was my gym teacher, he didn't believe me either.  I believe that people say ""walk it off"" too much.
	Face it, if you get hurt below the knee you will probably be told to ""walk it off"" by someone: a teacher, a friend, maybe even yourself.  It almost seems that if you don't ""walk it off"" you aren't tough enough, or you aren't ""man"" enough (in some people's opinions).  Does it make you more of a man to cause yourself permanent bodily damage?  Are injuries now a sign of manhood?  Seriously, if you break your ankle you need to get it in a cast, not ""walk it off.""  I'm not saying that you need to immediately treat every little bump or bruise, but some injuries need to be treated faster: broken bones and sprains are just a couple examples.
	When I sprained my ankle I tried to walk it off and that just made it worse.  When it happened I was walking down to a local fast food place after the school play (I was doing the sound work).  There was about fifty people in all, about half girls.  I tripped and hurt my ankle.  I didn't think it was anything serious so I told myself to ""walk it off.""  Besides I couldn't look weak in front of that many girls, it would be the end of my dating for a long time.  My ankle didn't hurt too much that night.  The next morning, however, it really started hurting, so I went to the doctor and got an X-ray.  The doctor said it was broken and gave me one of those special boots to wear.  A couple days later a radiologist looked at the X-rays and said that it was just a sprain, but walking on it that night didn't do any good.  I learned my lesson, but what about the rest everyone else.  Why is it that all men are required to take pain like ""Rambo""?  Next time think before you tell someone to ""walk it off.""

I believe the world would be a better place if people were more open to new ideas, cultures, and religions.  If people were nonjudgmental of races and cultures, I believe some semblance of peace on Earth could be achieved.   
As a child, I had my eyes wide open when viewing the world, I thought of it as a place where people accepted and celebrated their differences.  I thought this because maybe I was just naïve or I didn't see any wrong in others.   I vividly remember the day that made my eyes a bit droopy.  It was September 11, 2001, this was the day my eyes were opened to something else, the destruction of passing judgment on other religions and cultures could cause.  As I watched people from other nations celebrating on the streets during our crises, I was astonished.  These people knew nothing about the people who were killed or affected by the terrorist attack.  They were putting every American into a single identity who obviously they did not care for.  I vowed I would never view a group of people in this way.  
This lesson obviously was not learned by other fundamentalists on this tragic day.  As our country declared war on the country of Iraq I was shocked.  I always thought of America as a place of justice, a place where any person could be accepted, and a country that no longer viewed individuals with racism or prejudice.  Our country passed the same racism and prejudiced as the terrorists on September 11th, when it started a war with a place where the people, culture, politics, and religion are different from its own.  In this war, our country has tried to make the country of Iraq more like our own, and as a result, the war has been unsuccessful and tragic.  As I watch the news every night I think about the downward spiral the world has begun to go in, and it seems to all go back to people's inability to look openly at new ideas and people.   
Just recently was the five year anniversary (if you can call it that) of the Iraq War.  And in those five years over 4,000 American troops have lost their lives to this cause.  Millions of Iraqis have been misplaced from their homes and their lives disrupted.  Some children can no longer attend schools while families must flee for their safety and hope.  Iraqis lives may have been horrible under rule of Saddam.  They didn't have as many freedoms, people were ruthlessly murdered, but there was some civil disobedience where people could function with their lives.    Still five years in this mess the tunnel remains dark as no light has begin to shed in on when this could all be over or what needs to be done to consider removing our troops.  
I've learned that judgment of strangers is inappropriate.  The only sound judgment I can make in regards to other people is by meeting individuals and understanding who they are, where they came from, obstacles they have overcome, and what they believe in.  Since I am viewing individuals in this manner I expect the same from others around the world when they are judging Americans.

		Growing up I would sit and daydream about my life, what kind of man I would marry, how many kids I would have. Three children boy, girl, boy in that order, God granted it to me. I'm the oldest girl of three children, the last one to get married and the last to leave home. Of course, I was in no hurry. It was always hard to make up my mind about things. I would ask someone else's opinion first, to help me out which gave me choices. My husband is over confident and willing in that area to guide me in what he thinks is best. 	
	 My children are sixteen(boy), thirteen(girl),and nine(boy) very different but look alike in their features. Everyone has always said that we all look alike. When my first child was born, we did everything together. We would spend more time together than his dad would because he was on the golf course. My husband is the only child, and I love him dearly, but my mother-in-law loves him more as she would so kindly put it. Sometime she would appear so genuine, and, at times, totally the opposite. I am still praying for situation so that I wouldn't take to heart even though it hard to I love her anyway. I've always gotten along with people, this required some effort because people are different. I did what I could to try to please my mother-in-law, it was a no win situation if it wasn't on her terms.  
		 When my oldest was about nine months old, he was trying to take steps in learning how to walked by grasping on to things for support. My mother-in-law felt no one could take care of him like she could. One spring weekend we wanted to get away for a day. So we did  and i felt guilty leaving him with her. I was not married at this particular time. My sister decided to have a  party for my cousin, so we went while my mother in-law babysat for us. We returned the next morning, and she met me, and my husband outside explaining herself that she didn't think that she had to call to let us  know what had happened. I  ran in the house to find my baby's hands wrapped in gauzes, lying on her bed asleep I had never felt so bad for leaving my baby that night. I cried endlessly, asking God to remove the anger that I felt for her in my heart and to touch his hands to remove the pain that he was going through. He suffered first degree burns from touching a kerosene heater were she had to pull his hands from. She had company that day that took her mind off of him. 										I was in shock  he  was just learning to walk, and, because of his surgery with skin graphs, wearing a cast, I thought this would delay him. I was so wrong, God answered my prayer. I found forgiveness in my heart for her, and, thankful that my son is alright. I have been blessed in the whole process, the nurse had to come out to clean his hands in making sure no infection appeared.  That was very painful to see and to hear, I'm so proud of him. He is left handed and draws like a professional artist. I will never know if the burns had anything to do with him being left-handed or right-handed, but he was so active as a child nothing stopped him from having fun. I've learned that holding on to past hurts only damages the spirit and the heart. Finding forgiveness is the best thing for everyone because no one is perfect.

043857.txt,Chrissy,,30 - 50,"Kingsland, Georgia","April 24, 2008",2008,Practice What You Preach,golden rule;tolerance,"As a mother and youth minister, I have always said to my biological children and to the teens of the Youth Group, ""don't judge others before you get to know them…people are not often what they appear to be…how someone acts and how they are when you have a conversation with them can be two different things"". 
We consider our family to be an average everyday family. Both parents work, the children attend public school, and we attend church together on Sundays. When my oldest daughter was a freshman in high school she had the opportunity to go with the church youth group on a ski trip. She really wanted to go, but like all teenagers it was important for her to know who else would be going. When I told her who the other two girls were that would be going on the trip (I'll call them Kim and Jill) she wasn't so sure she really wanted to go. Her response was, ""Kim is a prep and Jill is a snob and stuck-up"". I immediately said, ""You don't even know these girls. If you got to know them you might find out you like them"". Of course she responded with more negativity. 
I convinced her to go on the trip since she really wanted to. When I went to pick her up, guess what? She had a great time. After hugging everyone good-bye she got into the car and said, ""Mom, you were right. Kim is the sweetest person and Jill is hysterical. I had the best time. They really aren't how they appear to be in school"". Lesson learned. Right? Well, you would think so. However, Mom had a rude awaking when she discovered she wasn't practicing what she preached.
While on a mission trip with the youth group the adults were required to attend a mandatory meeting one afternoon to help prepare them for that evening's program. All the programs each evening had been fun and full of praise and worship, singing, and skits. This evening was going to be more serious program for the teens and the directors wanted to inform the adults of what to expect. During the meeting this one particular man would not quit interjecting his thoughts and opinions. He had been on this particular mission before and knew what to expect, but I thought he was being a know-it-all, one of those people who had to be the center of attention, and he was causing this meeting to be dragging on. I just wanted him to be quiet and let the directors talk. He really aggravated me and I instantly had a negative opinion of him.
That evening at program the teens were able to go and pray with an adult about whatever issues were on their mind. They could ask the adult to pray for them, pray for others, or just to listen to them while they talked. When the teens were done the adults would also have the same opportunity to go and pray with another adult if they wanted to. 
My father was a recovering alcoholic and had been sober for ten years. A few months before this trip he began to drink again. He was constantly on my mind and in my prayers. So, I thought I would go and sit with one of the other adults to pray with me. When I ventured forward to the prayer area there was only one person who did not have someone with him praying. Guess who? It was the know-it-all from the adult meeting earlier that day. Well, I couldn't turn around because he was staring right at me and that would have been rude. I really did not want to go and share with him, but I moved toward him and sat down. When I began to share with him about my concerns for my father he began to smile with a tear in his eye. I stopped talking. He said, ""Isn't amazing how God brings two people together? I am a recovering alcoholic and I have been sober for 6 years. I know what my drinking did to my family and how it affected us all"". We talked for a while and he was wonderful to talk to, compassionate, and understanding. I realized that during the meeting he was just trying to help prepare us for the evening from his own experiences at past missions. 
I had to reflect on my experience with my daughter a year earlier and realize that if I was going to lecture and give advise about judgment, I should probably listen to myself first and ""practice what I preach"". I now share that story when I'm trying to explain how easy it is for all of us to be trapped under the umbrella of judgment, but also to let them know you can learn from it as a guide to give everyone a fair chance. I certainly have and reflect on my own experience each time I am tempted to judge before knowing.

044696.txt,Anna,,18 - 30,"Hurricane, West Virginia","May 3, 2008",2008,I believe in letting go.,death;family;forgiveness,"Letting it All Out
	I believe in letting it all out, so I can finally begin to heal. 
	In February of 2001, my life changed forever. I was 11 years old and just starting out my second semester of fifth grade. One Saturday night, I was sitting in the living room with my mom, grandma, and grandpa, when the phone rang. Grandma answered the phone. It was my Aunt Tina. ""Ernie's been shot, we're on our way to the hospital."" 	
	Ernie was my uncle, my best friend and next to my grandpa, the closest thing I had to a dad while I was growing up. He was the kind of guy you could just tell everything to and no matter how bad things were, his goofy sense of humor would cheer you up.
	That one simple phone call started to turn everyone in the room to a bunch of hand wringing people with many questions on their minds. Who shot him? Is he OK? Why haven't they called yet?
	Then finally the phone rang again and Grandma ran to it. The next few moments of my life are a blur. I can remember a horrible, heartbreaking sound. My grandma's scream. ""My baby, my baby,"" she said between her sobs. I remember Grandpa taking the phone and talking, but I don't remember what he said. I just sat there staring at what was happening, wondering why they were screaming and crying. Then it hit me.
	He's dead.
	My best friend, my uncle, the only one who could always make the world a happy place.
	He's gone.
	I ran to the front porch. I couldn't breath. My mom came and held me and we just sat there.
	About a month after his death all the lies about who killed him stopped. Tina kept telling us it was a big ""black"" guy that chased him down and shot him for his wallet. I remember when the family came in for the funeral they kept all the kids locked in the house, afraid that the man had followed them. In truth, the killer had slept in our living room and stood next to me at the burial. See, after Tina and her family returned to Indiana, the man that was living with them, Damien Slaughter, confessed to murdering my uncle. It turns out that he was Tina's lover and they had tried multiple times to rid themselves of my uncle so that they could collect the $50,000 life insurance that he had. After months of trials, they are now in prison.
	It's been almost seven years now. Most of the stuff I've written I've kept bottle in me for that long. I believe that I need to let go, to forgive, to forget, and just feel better about life. I will never forget my wonderful uncle, but I hope writing this will help the pain start to go away.

045299.txt,Brittany,,18 - 30,"phoenix, Arizona","May 13, 2008",2008,This I believe,addiction;family;self-determination,"I believe that being the child of an addict makes you stronger. Once you have accepted the hurt rather than denying it entry, the healing process can truly begin. By being broken and betrayed you have the opportunity to build yourself higher than you ever were. When you are going through the motions, you may feel like there is no way life could benefit from all the pain. But in the end, looking back it all seems worth some of the anguish.
	My mom was an addict. Even though her lifestyle is not on the full throttle destructive path it was before, during, and after her pregnancy with me, she will always be a ""substance buff"" in my eyes.  She still fines happiness in manipulating her relationships with family and still is abusing prescription pain killers. The decisions and actions she took during my childhood are the strongest influence on my own choices. 
	From the beginning, I was not given the boosts I needed to be set up for success. No one can upstage the queen. For me, my falling apart and self-loath began early. My life felt empty all through my teen years. While all my friend's parents were encouraging them to love themselves, my mom was constantly pointing out my imperfections. My relationships with people fell apart before they could start because I did not know how to handle myself around people; I only knew how to act around addicts. Soon, the friends I felt safe confiding in began to dwindle. High school began and I did not have a nurturing mother in my corner. I never realized what I was missing until then.
	Depression sank in fast. I could not find comfort in simply pleasure I once enjoyed, I was isolating myself into my internal chaos, and I was bottling up any emotion that dare come to the surface. Confusion was all that flooded my brain. Why has she been gone for two weeks and no one knows where she is? Why doesn't she want to see us on Christmas? Why can't she open her eyes this morning? 
	I turned 18 this month and now is the time for me to write my own story. The path has been inflexible to accept how my mother has broken me and the people around her. However, this has only driven me to make a future for myself, and build a strong foundation for my children that my mother did not do for me. I still continue to deal with the pain of her actions everyday, but I do so with a new outlook. Instead of condemning myself to failure, I choose to end every step I take with hope. I believe being the child of an addict is okay; in the end you are a stronger person with a better sense of appreciation of the world around you.

I believe that one small gesture of kindness to another person can result in a happier world.  Just think-if every one in the world made some small gesture of kindness to someone else, like holding the door open for them or even smiling at them when you see them in the hall, there would be a blanket of compassion enveloping our world. But any spread of evil could make a hole in this blanket and soon enough we will have ripped it to shreds. 
	When I see the janitor in the hallway after school, I make an effort to say hi and ask him how he is.  This always seems to make him shine a little brighter.  I used to think, how can a simple question make him fell so good?  All I said was hi!  But then I'd think about how I would fell if I worked hard all day and no one even bothered to acknowledge the fact that I was there or how hard I was working.  
	I believe that every small act of kindness deserves applause.  I believe that even the smallest action should be recognized whether it is taking out the trash or cleaning the floors.  When we see someone doing something that is a ""lower-class job"", we think down upon them.  But we shouldn't think of them as lower-class, but as people that do the job that most of us wouldn't dare do.  I believe that taking the time to say hi to janitor is worth my time because that act of kindness makes all the difference.  This I believe.

My life is like 1 long song or a DJ putting together a mix that's the length of life, different songs being played at different times that can relate how I'm feeling at the time. I believe that it isn't money but music that makes the world go round 1 beat at a time, and God is the world's only and greatest DJ! People write or compose songs to express their feelings and use them as a stress reliever. 
I am 18 years old but have experienced some things in my life that would make me seem older. As a young adolescent I always had a feel for music, I would always play with instruments, starting with a little piano and then I moved to a drum set and now I DJ. I also got into making beats so now I use MIDI pianos and beat machines. When I'm in my studio composing beats, I tend to create depending on my mood at the time. If I'm feeling excited or ""crunk,"" I tend to make more up-tempo beats that will get somebody hyped, or if I'm feeling sad or depressed I'll work on more mellow beats. As a young kid I  was always into the rap genre and I started to rap because I would dream of being famous, I thought it was cool so as I progressed in life I would write in a notebook about my day, my dreams,  my goals in life. The older I got the more I wrote and one day little by little I started to write poems, which later turned to raps and ever since then I've been composing songs of all kinds. 
The most important song I've ever composed was a week after my grandmother passed away; she was the one who raised me as a young baby all until my first day of pre-school. The song that I composed was titled ""Struggle"" and the meaning of the title and song is that life is a struggle with people fighting everyday just to make it. Also being Hispanic, I still tend to be a victim of racism and discrimination. Even though people say that isn't true, they truly don't know because they aren't going through it so basically in the song I'm letting people know how it feels to grow up in the slums, being discriminated against, losing a loved one and how I hope one day all the war and hate will stop. 
We're a long way from peace but until that day my heart will keep pumping to the rhythm of the beat trying to promote peace and happiness. My veins will over flow with the melody that keeps me going on the pathway to a very successful life. My goals in life will keep me motivated to have the rest of the world enjoying my creations and help their hearts pump also.

I believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster FSM for short. Now this probably sounds pretty ridiculous; let me explain. I don't really believe that there is a giant monster made of spaghetti watching me, the whole idea of FSM is what I believe. Which is that if God is real with such little proof then everything no matter how insane must be real such as FSM. I am an atheist, now I don't look down on those who go to church and worship something I believe to be as real as a flying bowl of pasta. Religion does have its good points it preaches to do the right thing and help your fellow man in the name of God. What I believe though is why not do good for the sake of doing good instead of in the name of God. This is a big piece of what FSM is all about.
It has always been a mystery to me how people can base all of their beliefs and lives on something that they have no proof even exists. I'm not saying its wrong it just confuses me how people say God is the explanation for everything when we have science which can put forth solid proof and evidence to explain its points. I bring this up because the creator of FSM was a science professor at a university out east. He was told that if he was going to teach evolution in his biology class he had to teach the creation theory right along with it. He argued that he doesn't want to teach something that there is absolutely zero real solid evidence that it happened. So finally he said if I have to teach the creation theory I will teach the Flying Spaghetti Monster theory because it's just as real as the creation theory so FSM was born.
The basis of FSM is that if we all focus on the here and the now and try to explain things with solid evidence we could accomplish so many things. One example is stem cell research, those who are pro science are completely for stem cell research but those who are religious tend to be anti stem cell. I understand why those who are against it think its wrong but really think about it, the babies whose stem cells we are using were going to die if they weren't already dead. With their stem cells we could cure almost every kind of handicap, paralyzed people, the deaf, the blind and so on and so forth. You see we could accomplish so many things and this is what FSM teaches. This I believe.

I consume the energy people send around me and use it to my advantage.  I don't have a belief of a certain kind, but I do try to find a way that will get me through everyday.  
I sit and look at the way people are in general; the way they eat, the way they talk, the way they interact with others, etc. By far, it seems hard for me to sit and try to tolerate how ignorant people can really be. It seems no one really has the interpretation on what life is suppose to be like.  I hear everyday how much stress money puts on people or how hard it is for someone to walk across the street to get food, without taking their car. I'm not saying that I dislike people or think people are stupid, but I am stating that people's motives nowadays seem to be useless for our future and are deepening the past. Our modern day humanity lives like there is no past and like there is no tomorrow.
When people are upset, they send off the energy that comfort is needed.  That's an example of where I come in on my everyday life. I soak up that energy and I use that energy to my advantage. I use it to make others feel better and come in check with reality.  I try to be a loving person and show others there's a purpose in life; they just have to find their specific purpose. 
For most people, it is hard for them to find a purpose. They may know right away, but first they have to find their selves. As for me, I have been through more than what most teenagers will ever go through.  These past experiences have given me opportunities to sit back and observe how I can make my purpose in life one that will not be forgotten, but will also benefit the future for everyone. I needed someone like that in my life when I had complicated pastimes; that is why I try to live this life to my advantage and show love to everyone.
I just let things take their own path and look out for branches and rocks that may get in the way.  I know help and guidance will keep things sturdy and make me a stable person. Everyone has infinite potential inside them, but they need that push to help them through, which is why I sit back and look for those in need.  I would like to call myself someone who rehabilitates people's minds into who they should be. Everyone should act themselves and love them selves to share it amongst the world. I want change for everyone and in order to do that, it starts with me.

Last summer I thought I had nothing to look forward to in the next year, due to the fact many of my friends were leaving and I had already met everyone I wanted to. I was dreading the new year; I spent a lot of time thinking about how boring and dull it would be. As the year began I didn't meet anyone that interested me and I was being pessimistic to change, but as the year progressed I found myself being more open to people and less cynical about things. After the change I was aware that everyone around me had something to teach me. Not only was I meeting new people and learning lessons from them, but I was also sharing things with them and letting them in on my life.  I went from thinking there was nothing to look forward to, to having a better situation then I had before hand. 
Every person you encounter in your life can teach you something; whether they have been your best friend for 30 years, your parent your whole life, or a taxi cab driver you spent a maximum of 15 minutes with, every person has the ability to impact you and change your views. If you ask people about their stories and actually listen, you can learn much more than you ever could alone. You will be learning from mistakes without actually making mistakes; you will be hearing about something that you may never have the chance, time, or money to do for yourself. Their stories may only be stories but if you listen carefully you can get a deeper meaning than just a mere story, you can visualize and experience it very lucidly. 
You need to have an open and free thinking mind, you must be able to appreciate other beliefs and respect the fact that not everyone thinks the same because of the way they have been brought up. By asking people about their experiences you will affect other individuals as well, they will learn from you and you can tell your story. After all it's our differences that make us who we are, not our similarities. I believe in learning something new from each and every person, this I believe.

046191.txt,Zachary,,Under 18,"Princeton, Illinois","May 27, 2008",2008,Hope,hope,"Two years ago, my aunt died of breast cancer that had just spread way too far. But that was not the first time she had been through problems. When I was very young my aunt was in a horrible accident. She was driving her car she slid under a semi-truck. Luckily, God was on her side. She wasn't wearing her seatbelt so she was able to duck as the truck took off the top of the car. Surviving with serious injuries to her head, she was in the hospital for a long time she had seen many things and thought nurses were trying to poison her.
When she finally got out she was a new person in good ways and in some ways not. She had changed in the way she was a lot more careful, less of a daredevil about life. People also changed their opinions about her because of her change in mood. This taught me something though; she survived through such tragedy with hope. Hope is one thing that keeps all cancer patients able to survive another day. Hope is also something little kids get at Christmas, but that's a different hope.
When my aunt got very sick with cancer she stayed at my house for awhile. I always hoped she would get better, but she got worse and eventually died. For awhile I thought hope was useless, but it turns out maybe my hope helped her awhile ago when she survived her horrible car crash.
If I ever give up hope because life just seems to be going against you, just think maybe my hope is going somewhere else. Maybe even to a greater cause, so I would have to say I should never give up hope even in situations like September eleventh, or other horrible disasters.
If my aunt taught me anything, which she did, the thing she taught me most is to always have hope. I'm very sad she died, but I know she's in a better place. I will always keep up my hope in life. There is no time when I won't have hope. This I believe.

046318.txt,Matthew,,Under 18,"Vista, California","May 28, 2008",2008,Saving the World Through the Power of Understanding,self-knowledge,"Many believe the state of our world is at a threshold of uncontrollably hatred and discrimination of all who are different. It is a state that has been worsening every step we take into the future. It seems like a pretty grim outcome but I believe there is still a glimmer of hope for the people of this world. Through my experiences as a high school senior, I have experienced many events that have changed my life and my opinion of people in society. 
	During the month of October I was given the honor to serve with the Carlsbad Police Department and help at a fire relief center. The Fire was a serious and unfortunate event for many in San Diego County. A lot of good people lost everything they owned and some were lucky to come out with their lives. 
	Being a Carlsbad Police Explorer, a lot of people were depending on immediate help for their problems and it became overwhelming for the officers who were trying everything they could to help. A lot of people were in a deep state of depression and the only thing I could do was comfort them. Everything seemed grim until our community opened up to these people. 
	It started with people offering to buy waters with their own money too donating rooms in their homes for those who had lost theirs. In one instance a lady had rescued all of her dogs and evacuated her house. When she had reached the Carlsbad Relief Post she had heard her house was burnt to the ground in Ramona. So she sat on the curb and started crying. Just then a family from Oceanside offered to take in her dogs and allowed her to spend the remainder of the time in their house. A family who had never met this woman opened up their house for her.
	By the time I had left the post at around ten thirty families all around North County had donated so much that we had to redirect them to another emergency relief center. I came back the next day to work and still people were dropping supplies off. 
	Often I find myself looking back at the events of the world today and agree with first statement. Innocent people being murdered in Africa just because they were born in a different tribe, or innocent people being killed in Ireland just because they have a different view on Christianity. It seems the world is sinking lower and lower, but when I look at my own community I get the sense that there is still hope. I find it amazing how a community of people who were not affected by the fires donated so much to the people who were affected. Through the actions of so many in October I believe that we can come together as a world too. There is so much going on in the world that we can help form turning any worse. 
This I believe that if we take a step back and try to understand each other like the people of San Diego County. To try to help bring the end of the discrimination of the world and understand one another as human beings, then I believe we can live in a world free of discrimination and brutality.

046400.txt,Benjamin,,18 - 30,"North Wales, Pennsylvania","May 28, 2008",2008,The Power of Laughter,humor & laughter,"I believe in the power of laughter. 
	Two years ago, I was selected to attend the Hugh O'Brien Youth Leadership Conference (HOBY). Although I learned much from this experience, I gained more as an individual from an event after this conference, in which I had to make a presentation about my experiences at HOBY in front of my sponsors, the Woman's Whitpain Club. I vividly remember the day of the presentation. I was a nervous wreck, unsure of how to reach out to my audience who, yes were mostly all old white ladies. I started out miserably with a shaky voice, trembling hands, and eyes that could not look beyond my note cards. But, when I started telling my experiences through past humorous episodes in my life and somehow digressing from the topic of leadership to Donald Trump's ridiculous haircut, I really started to connect with my audience. Their laughter broke this once impenetrable ice that stood between us and I connected to them as if I were their best friend. You see, it was through this experience when I realized that even I could connect to this once distant audience through laughter.
	Often times I wonder why people need to laugh. After all if you think about it, laughter is a convulsion of spasmodic breaths. You hear laughter on the sitcoms albeit recorded and artificial, from your friends when you crack a corny joke, or from the little newborn infants. It ranges from the small, unsure-if-I'm-supposed to laugh form when someone tells a really awkward joke to the full blown, teary eyed form when you hear a quality Chuck Norris joke. But really people just laugh because it is a natural human reaction and because it helps to unload from the stresses of life. 
	As in my experience with the old ladies from the women's club, laughter provides a means to ease up tense and awkward situations, and helps people to connect with one another. Just think about any really good past motivational speakers that you have encountered. They always use humor and their life experiences to connect with you the audience. Once you establish this connection, the audience begins to understand you as a fellow human being and wants to hear your every word. In the end what it comes down to is that life is too short for you to always be serious. When a person tries to rebel against his natural instincts and remain grim, they ultimately feel miserable. So you should embrace your natural self and realize that through laughter you have the means to move the hearts of others and yourself.

046431.txt,James,,Under 18,"West Wareham, Massachusetts","May 29, 2008",2008,Best Friends,brotherhood & friendship;forgiveness,"This I Believe 
I believe in best friends. I believe every secret should be concealed in one ear, and never touch the keeper's lips and every tear should be shed on one single shoulder. I believe everyone deserves a best friend, or more than just one, many. I feel that my two best friends are the best anyone could ever ask for. A best friend is someone you confide in, laugh too hard with, stay up late with, and even cry with. A best friend is not just anyone, they're special. They have a way of making even the greyest of days beautiful. I believe in best friends for a deeper reason see, I believe in love.
Having a best friend is like having a sibling, or an addition sibling to hang around with. After a while you begin to become one in the same as a person. You'd think that after years of arguing over who's smarter, more athletic, more popular, or better looking, you'd grow to despise your bestie, but that just doesn't seem possible. You become so engrossed in a bond of friendship that nothing else matters. You love them. Over time, you develop a sense of understanding of your best friend that no one else can fathom. But what happens when you've just had enough?
For a while now, Heather and myself have been tighter than a pair of jeans two sizes two small. We did everything together; shopped, ate, cooked, cleaned, virtually everything. Everyday was spent with just the two of us doing something, anything to pass the time; it didn't matter as long as we were together. But one day, we got into a fight and didn't talk for almost three days. I dreamt of the day I would have peace and quiet. No Heather. But that day came and all I could do was pray for a single word to serenade from her lips and caress my ears as to sooth my soul. We couldn't stay mad at each other, we were each others other half's, we completed each other. 	
It wasn't so much the fact that we shared a common friendship that drew us to each other, but it was something else we shared; we both loved each other. Being a part f this amazing thing we call friendship has given me something to look forward to each day. It has made me feel like I have a purpose and I'm happy to fulfill it for Heather! Everyday I look back at all the times my flaws and my bad habits displayed themselves for all to see, and I can't help but smile knowing Heather loves me for all of those bad things, and that's what makes me realize that without a best friend, our lives would contain a large void that would need to be filled. Every time I look back at all the good, the bad, and the ugly that I've been through, I am reminded of the one person who was always beside me. Therefore, I believe in best friends.

046563.txt,Michelle,,Under 18,"Bal harbour, Florida","June 1, 2008",2008,I believe in dancing.,self-knowledge,"Since I was three years old I have admired dancing. I have taken almost every type of dance including, ballet, jazz, tap, you name it. I danced at a studio in Miami for 10 years until I was 12 years old. I was sick of the rules, the instructors, and most importantly the stupid pink tights, so I stopped. This is why I believe in dancing. I'm not talking about classical ballet, or hip-hop, I'm talking about the type of dance you do when no one's watching. The type of dance you do when your favorite song comes on and you let go in front of your bathroom mirror. The type of dance that is free-spirited and has no rules to it. 
Whenever I have a stressful week I go out and dance with my friends.  It's a great way to unwind and shake the stress away. Whether its at a party, in my room, or on top of some sort of table, dancing lets me step out of reality and into my own zone where the music carries me away. I believe in stepping out of your comfort zone and taking risks. It is such an amazing feeling to just let go and focus on nothing but you and the rhythm of the music. I personally believe that if everyone would dance and unwind to their favorite song there would be a lot less stress in today's society. 
Dancing has given me a lot more confidence in myself. It takes alot to get out in front of a crowd and bust out your own moves without getting starred or laughed at. Sometimes I wonder what other people are thinking when I dance, but there perspective is not important to me. I believe in enjoying yourself as you are and not letting people's opinions influence that. Dancing has helped me deal with a lot of issues by not letting myself get too worked up and irritated. It's how I cope with things that cannot be said in words, like anxiety and stress. I believe in dancing because it lets me focus on myself and helps me realize that you shouldn't take life too seriously. It's a great way to burn calories while letting go in the music and unwinding from my everyday stresses.

As I share Bible passages with sheep like ones, I try to follow Jesus' example and the love he showed for his sheep and remember the words he said, ""If you love me, feed my little sheep."" It has been the most rewarding part of my life.

046632.txt,Jason,,Under 18,"Boise, Idaho","June 2, 2008",2008,The Way I See It,values & spirituality,"I believe in the value of being an individual. All my life I have been influenced by three different cultures. My father is from London, England. My mother is from Sydney, Australia. And, of course, I live in the United States. For the last 14 years of my life, I have had long distance communication with both sides of my family, and sometimes face to face contact. Every time we talk, I get critiqued on every aspect of my life. Each side of the family tries to tell me which way is right. Whether it be that I say a word incorrectly, or I play the wrong sport, or I eat the wrong food. For Example, if I wrote the word center and spelled it c-e-n-t-r-e my English and Australian families would praise me, but I would be rejected by the American culture. Or if I used the word soccer instead of football, I would be rejected by the English and Australian cultures, but I would be accepted by the American culture. When I was eleven years old I was traveling in Australia, and I happened across a town with my parents and I pronounced the town as Gosford instead of Gosferd. It was a word that I would regeret saying fort the rest of my life because I haven't heard the end of it since. Some of my family still refer to me as the Gosford boy. It is events like these that influence me to conform to my families teachings.
	 It is very tough to be involved with three different cultures. Since I have an American accent, I am known as the ""Yank"" overseas (and that is not always a good thing). But when I am in America, people think I am backwards because I was born ""down under"". People seem to think that your culture defines you. Americans think I wrestle crocs and put shrimps on barbecues. And English and Australian people think that I am a Republican and that I enjoy hunting. Both of which are very untrue. Through my experiences with all three cultures, I have come to believe that none of them are correct. There is no correct way to pronounce the word tomato and there is no correct way to spell center. I have come to realize that I should decide which way feels correct for me, not my family. It is better for me to be an individual and please myself, than please my family by conforming to their ways.

046764.txt,Alexander,,Under 18,"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania","June 4, 2008",2008,Ignorance,faith & religion,"I believe that when man creates or associates himself with any type of religion it is because he does not want to try to understand human nature. I find that people believe in a religion because they are afraid of finding the meaning of live and that they need some type of super natural being or basic set of rules that govern their lives so that they don't have to contemplate their life. They just leave the way their lives go to their superior being and that is all.
	Over the last two years, my parents have forced me into being confirmed by the catholic church. Of course, I greatly disagree with their ideas so I would basically zone out for the entire time or I would figure out how I could make it really awkward for the teachers to continue teaching. Several months ago I was forced to go on a retreat that was basically in the mountains, in the middle of the woods. That was the ultimate way of driving a person crazy, when you send them outside of civilization with a bunch of people  who try and force their ideas on you. The whole time I really tried to destroy the balance or ignore them completely. It was beside the point that most of the activities that we did were designed for toddlers, but I did very little for any of them and I made up a lot of stories. That night when we were sleeping I told the people in my bunk about how god is dead and that nothing matters because nothing is real. I really irked some people and some I got the wheels turning. The next day we had to write questions for the priest to answer when he came to the woods. I asked if God was real to see what he would say. That was a crucial point of the weekend and of my religious views. When he answered my question, instead of giving me a descent answer that was well thought out and really came from their beliefs, he basically told me what St. Thomas Aquinas wrote in his text, Summa Theologica. That was all he could come up with. There was no originality in telling me the 5 ways of gods existence and it really opened my eyes. It made me alter my beliefs, that religion is just an excuse for ignorance.

046807.txt,Steven,,18 - 30,"Fair Haven, New Jersey","June 5, 2008",2008,Life lessons,carpe diem,"I believe that life is anything but short, actually it's long. I believe that no matter what happens in life, you have plenty of time to make it better no matter how bad it is. You lose your job, in two weeks you could have another one. You have some one die in your family, in a few months you could soon find a way to turn it into a way of remembrance and happiness and leave the sadness for the past. 
I'm only fourteen years old and already people have told me that life is so short and you have to make the best of each day. Since I've been seven my families been telling me this. You have to do this, work on that because life's to short to slack off. Since I've been seven years old I've taken this really close to heart, and since then I've been trying to do just that. My family use to use an old saying that went like this ""make the most of each day, because your never sure when you're not going to wake up and you will never know that one day when you get hit by a bus. Remember lives to short to slack off"". But as I've lived my life for this supposedly short fourteen years I've came to a thought a life lesson in a way. And this lesson that I've come to is that, life's long the fact of the matter is that you probably will wake up tomorrow and go about your day, and you're probably not going to get hit by a bus as you walk across the street. 
I've been alive for fourteen years and to me they might as well have been a hundred years with how slow there going. No matter what happens you will have enough time to change it for the better, so instead of going through your days acting like it's your last and driving yourself to the ground trying to get the most out of it, try realizing that its probably not your last day and instead of driving your self to the ground just have fun. Meet up with friends or family and relax on the couch and watch TV, or take your family on a trip to somewhere new and just have fun with them . And instead of the old theory that life's to short to not make the most out of every day here's my new one.  Life's long; too long to go through it not enjoying each day to fullest. Because if you don't enjoy everyday of life, what's the point of living that day?
	Don't take this story as if I wish life was short and I hate mine, because if that's all you get out of this story then your missing the big picture. Because I love my life, if I could change one thing in my life, the chances are I probably wouldn't. Life's long and I plan on enjoying every minute of it.

047096.txt,Amanda,,Under 18,"Londonderry, New Hampshire","June 11, 2008",2008,Animal Abuse in Entertainment,empathy & compassion,"Animal Abuse in Entertainment
I believe all animals should have the right to live freely in their natural habitat. Every day, animals are used against their will to entertain humans. They are overworked, poorly cared for, and are never given the chance to live in the wild. Circuses, zoos, and horse races are just three practices that are accepted in our society that I believe mistreat animals and should not be accepted.
	Circuses are thought of as a great American tradition, but the way they treat animals is hardly that. Wild animals are taken out of their habitats only to be tortured and trained to do humiliating tricks for the entertainment of humans. They are often beaten and overworked while being trained to do these tricks. Most of these animals are also kept in unsuitable conditions such as cramped, uncomfortable cages. Some cities throughout the nation have even started banning the use of wild circus animals because of the inhumane treatment from which the animals suffer.
	Thousands of people visit zoos each day in the U.S. These zoos contain animals that were taken from the wild or born in captivity without a chance of ever living in the wild. In the past, most zoos were simply rows of tiny, concrete cages. Theses zoos were also unable to provide the correct climate each animal needed year round. Now, most modern zoos keep animals in large areas that re-create an animal's natural habitat. They are also able to keep animals in areas where the temperature can be controlled. However, even with these many animal-friendly renovations, most zoos are more focused on the entertainment value of the center than the animals well being and needs. Zoos can provide an educational and entertaining experience for visitors as long as they keep animal care as the highest priority.
	Horse racing is a popular sport that is almost always associated with gambling. This is the cause of one of the biggest problems relating to horse racing. Since winning is the main concern to horse owners, they are focused on what is best for a successful race, not what is best for the horse. If a horse does not win race, that horse is generally given away or sometimes even killed. To try to ensure that horses win, trainers overwork the horses and often use drugs to enhance their performance. Another method often seen is the use of whips. They are used by jockeys to speed a horse up during a race. They could, however, also lead to a horse collapsing, meaning all the horses and jockeys participating in the race would be put in danger. There was a recent death of a racehorse during the Kentucky Derby. The horse, named Eight Belles, placed second, but broke her two front ankles and ended up dying. This caused commotion throughout the racing world and also proved that things at horse races need a change. If racehorses were to be treated with more care, their careers and lives would last much longer.
	Animals used in entertainment never have the chance to live in their natural habitat. Spreading awareness of animal mistreatment can help to improve conditions at places such as circuses, zoos, and horse races. Petitions are just one thing people could do to stop these and other kinds of animal cruelty. Being aware of animal abuse and reporting it when it is seen are other simple things that can be done to prevent it. If everyone did one of these small things then there would be one more improvement for the animals in our world.

047098.txt,Joseph,,Under 18,"Fort Wayne, Indiana","June 11, 2008",2008,The bridge to my horizon,self-determination,"My father's life has greatly influenced my own in a number of ways. He has taught me the value of education and the importance of perseverance to reach my academic goals. The personal experiences of someone so close to me have taught me that I can achieve anything if I put my effort wholly behind my endeavors, whatever they may be. 
	My dad spent a number of years in college and then went on to earn his medical degree which allowed him to become what he is today, a pediatrician. His college road, like the road of all medical students, was not an easy one. He struggled through a difficult curriculum to go from a general understanding of medicine to a mastery of his specific field. This devotion to academic success has left a lasting imprint on my character. 
	From him, I have learned that everyone goes through trying times to achieve their dreams. Every individual must overcome his own, unique obstacles in order to attain what he desires the most out of life. These trials may take on many forms, but the dream stays the same. 
I strive to emulate his dedication in every aspect of my own life. For example, this is true in friendships, sports, and most importantly, in school. Though I don't know exactly what career I would like to pursue, I am certain that I will to choose a path that will allow me to help others. I may not follow in my dad's footsteps and become a physician, but I will heed his lessons and follow his example of hard work and dedication. I know that I cannot reach any of my goals in life if I don't first do well in my studies. 
During my first year of high school I experienced what it meant to live my father's message. I had a relatively demanding academic schedule and, at the same time, I was training for my eleventh year of gymnastics competition. At many times, especially during finals week, I thought of taking it easy and ending my studies early to relax. But then, my dad would come home late from work and I was reminded of his message. Seeing him gave me renewed vigor in my schoolwork, as I saw what I could become if I put in just that much more effort in my daily work.   
I have learned that the fruits of my labor may not be seen immediately, but every challenge that I overcome will bring me one step closer to my final goal, and the experiences that lead me there will be enriching ones that will shape the content of my character for years to come.   
Knowledge is the gateway for future vocational opportunities, and I always have this in mind. Success in the future is, for the most part, dependant upon past success in school. My dad is the chief reminder of what I can become in the future if I'm focused and dedicated in the present.

As I lay awake, I begin flipping through the channels and flashing across the screen is a recurring theme between each local news station – a person's health.  It's so true, everywhere we look there are innovative ways to get people active and into a healthier lifestyle. The hard part, for most people, is they do not want to actually put forth the effort to yield any results. Therefore the move toward a better life is halted by sheer laziness.
Recently, my mother and I began a workout plan towards a better life. Neither of us have any health problems nor are we overweight, yet together we feel we could use some extra energy. The science of it is when our heart rate is increased our body releases endorphins which act as natural painkillers that create a temporary sense of euphoria, also known as 'runners high'. As a result of our hard work we feel better about ourselves, are no longer fatigued after only a day of work, and use the weekends as family time rather than time to catch up on lost Z's. 
Secondly, by daily budgeting thirty minutes of aerobic activity we can increase our life span by years. My grandma, on my father's side of the family, recently experienced a severe back injury resulting in three operations. Although she endured much physical pain she persevered and is back to yoga and a bike ride in the morning. On the contrary, my grandma, on my mother's side of the family, went though a taxing knee surgery a few years back and has not yet quite recovered and there is a constant fear she will never be healed. The point of these short anecdotes is just this: the grandma with back complications sought physical therapy and was determined to get back into shape and with a mere thirty minute recumbent bike ride daily she has reached her goal. However, the grandma with the knee difficulties threw in the towel and accepted being disabled, when in turn if she worked hard she would be in better health today. Both of these grandmas are seventy-six years of age, yet one seems fifty and the other seems almost ninety!
On a clarifying note, I am not saying for people never to eat and become work out fiends, but to simply take the stairs instead of the elevator, in turn taking that extra step to a healthier self. I believe exercise is longevity.

We are all prisoners within our society. We believe what our ears hear and what our eyes see. We are given the right to ""freedom of speech"". However we fall into trouble for expressing ourselves whether for being gay, an expression of an opinion that is different from other's and just bringing modern day society back into reality. 
When I was in third grade my teacher was lecturing us about WWII, and how 
America dropped the A bomb on Japan .I said to her ""I don't understand, why would they kill so many innocent people that's not right. She simply responded, ""Well if you don't like it then why don't you go back to Mexico?"", and then sent me outside for the remainder of the day. Simply for expressing myself which is what we are told to do as children to ask ""Why"" and to tell the adults at your school what you feel and what you don't understand. I believe that we do not uphold the freedom of speech. See we are given this so called freedom of speech but there are consequences for an expression. Also these rights are taken away from us when we enter school. Most of our right's are taken away from us. We are taught to do as we are told without asking questions. In junior high there was a staff member named Rudy. Now Rudy was told to be a very mean man.  A man who knows how to put students in their place. When I got to junior high I was told this exactly ""that's Rudy listen to him no matter what, do everything he says, When he tells you to jump you say How High?""One day I was walking through the quad at my junior high and Rudy was walking my way he said ""Hey Stop!!"" So I stopped. He then said jump and I didn't reply to him"". He said again ""Jump, when 
I tell you to jump you say HOW HIGH."" .Again I didn't respond I was nervous and a little intimidated by him. However I was sent to the office for not responding like the rest of the students would which is by saying ""HOW HIGH RUDY"". We are told when it's okay to eat, and when it's okay to go to the restroom. Our opinion really doesn't matter. 
         When we are in court we are told to hold a certain honor for the judge, Even though he means nothing to us. He control's a person's destiny whether innocent or not, But who is he to decide that. I believe that god is the only spirit that can judge any human being. We have to speak to the judge with respect or else, but why just because he was elected judge. And? We should all be treated equally what ever happened to the saying ""Respect is earned not given"". I don't know the judge .He is nothing to me but the chooser of my destiny and I believe with all my heart that it's just not fair..
        In the street's you see people looking down upon a Homeless, Mexican, Black, White, Asian person, but why? We are all people. We all need air as well as food to live. We all came out of our mother'. I believe we should all be treated equally, but something that really hurt to find out is. It doesn't matter what you believe. Because we're all in this food chain equal to the animal kingdom. Who cares what the workers think right? We only care about the big man the money makers. I honestly think that this won't be read on the radio. I believe it has the potential to be read. But it's better off for the people of the greatest nation of them all to not live in reality and keep on living in our own little worlds that we feel safe in. So I shall end it with this. I believe we should all be treated equally, that we should all have a shot to do what we want to do.

047291.txt,Laura,,18 - 30,"Garden City, Michigan","June 14, 2008",2008,Let Me Get That For You,golden rule,"The golden rule of life has always been ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" This lesson from the Bible seems so straightforward. Treat people how you would want to be treated. Unfortunately, this way of life is becoming more obsolete as time goes on. 
Recently, in Hartford, Connecticut, a 78 year old pedestrian was run over by a car. His body laid lifeless in the street with many bystanders looking on and walking over him without checking to see if he was alright. The man finally received help but only from a police officer that was responding to a different call. 
When I read about this story, I was shocked. Even if the bystanders were too scared to approach the man, why did they not call for help? With all the access to cellular phones there was no excuse to ignore this situation. As a human being, I am infuriated. It seems that many people have no regard for human life and each other. 
I do not understand why it has become so difficult to take less than five minutes out of our daily lives to help someone for instance open a door or help carry heavy packages. Much of the time there is no monetary gain, but the feeling knowing that someone has benefited by your actions should be enough. 
It is wonderful though when people step out of the ""me"" box and look to help someone in need. Last weekend, my mother was telling me that she had gotten a flat tire in the parking lot of her favorite store. Luckily, there was a man walking by at the same time. He asked if he could be of assistance by changing the bad tire to the spare one. She gratefully accepted his offer. When he finished changing the tires, she thanked him but said that she was sorry she did not have any cash to reward his kindness. He told her not to worry and just to return the favor to someone else.
This story really makes you think. If everyone just returned a favor to someone else, I truly believe that there would be no more suffering in the world. We would be too busy looking out for our fellow brother, making sure that they are okay. There would be no time for crime and the world would be a better place. 
It seems simple enough, treating someone the way you would want to be treated. Helping others the way you would want to be helped. If people stop and realize you are only as successful as your neighbor, maybe people would want to help more. Returning the kindness of someone else seems more beneficial than standing around waiting for the next person to help.

047615.txt,Mandi,,18 - 30,"Gretna, Louisiana","June 25, 2008",2008,I Believe in Today,carpe diem,"I believe in living one day at a time. Even though I am only a young adult, I have already realized that any time spent dwelling on the past or incessantly worrying about the future is time that is wasted. Don't get me wrong, I do believe that the past and the future are extremely important. Yet, all we can live for and enjoy is the present. If you don't do so, life will just pass you by.
Being a student for the past eighteen years of my life, I have had huge amounts of work dumped onto my lap. I constantly thought about how in the world it would all get done. Somehow it always was all completed when the time came. I used to let it consume me with constant anguish, and I saw that I was missing opportunities to travel, have fun, and just live. I realized that it was just not worth it. I wasn't happy, and if you are not happy, then you are not living.
 I have never been late on an assignment, but I have never been finished early either. Some people may call it procrastinating, but I simply say that it is enjoying life. Everything will get done, even if it requires staying up all night the hours before something is due. But for me, going out with my friends or watching a movie with my family is worth sacrificing a few hours of sleep. I am not saying that I ever ditch schoolwork, but I never stop living and enjoying life. I believe that living one day at a time is all about balancing your schedule.
Without time to just enjoy life, I would go crazy. People have questioned me my whole life about how I was valedictorian but managed to always attend the birthday party, the night on the town, or the dinner with friends. I would just reply that it is all about balance. I don't think people give themselves enough credit sometimes. If you know that you have set the time aside to do what needs to get done, then go out and enjoy the day. Really, it is all that you have. If your life ended tomorrow, wouldn't you want to say that you had a really awesome day today? Or at least that you did something you enjoyed in that day? It is a simple concept but one that people forget about so often in today's on-the-go, fast-paced society. 
So, take the time to breathe. Go to work, but make sure that you enjoy your coworkers. Make sure that you love your job because you have to go there daily. Play with your dog. Spend time with your children. Procrastinate. Stay out all night. Dance crazy. Take a nap. Study the night before. Give yourself credit for your abilities. Tell people that you love them. Be happy in the moment. Live for today.

047963.txt,Eric,,50 - 65,"Guilford, Connecticut","July 19, 2008",2008,Giving Grace to the Simplest Detail,creativity;values & spirituality,"This I believe: The fast way is the slow way.
I first heard that truth sitting on a metal folding chair in a small office on Fifth Avenue and  21st Street playing my trumpet. I was studying jazz improvisation with Joe Solomon, a protégé of the late Lenny Tristano.
Joe taught me much more than how to improvise on my trumpet. He taught me how to approach each moment, each task in my life as it happens. Joe taught me that the fast way really is the slow way.
This means focusing on the process, not the outcome. It means making the process work for you, working with the process. Too often we, in our impatience, work against the process.
To play jazz I needed to go through the process of becoming fluent in the alphabet of music — the scales. The major scales, the minor scales, the diminished and harmonic minors. And then the chords and then the classic tunes and then… 
How do you do that? The slow way, practice every day. Focus, breathe — make the time; keep the time. There is no other way. So the slow way is the fast way because it is the only way.
I knew all this from Joe, but it took me time to learn it. And it turns out to be true in everything that I do. I'm still learning all those things about playing and now I practice; every day.
And this has become the way I approach all my actions; parenting, partnering with my spouse, making love, counseling my clients, leading and especially, simply paying attention.
In all things, the slow way requires that I sustain my vulnerability, listen as deeply as I can to my intonation and sing for all I'm worth. 
I like to cook from scratch; making all the stocks and sauces, hand-making the pasta and even growing the produce when I can. I don't use recipes but rather follow forms and improvise; making up new words with the alphabet of flavor and texture, association and history.  Always taking the time to focus on the process, to make it beautiful every time. 
Just like playing the cycle of fifths — boring and hackneyed and likely filled with forced errors if you rush through it — as beautiful as song if you strive to give the simplest detail grace.

048113.txt,Pat,,65+,"Twin Bridges, Montana","July 28, 2008",2008,Flea Beetles,nature,"I am a brooder my nature, and the older I get, the gloomier I get.  It drives my family crazy.  Maybe, it is age, but then it may be there is more cause for gloom today.  Whatever.  I fret about the earth and the wild creatures on it probably more than is good for me.  So, my kids let out a collective sigh of relief on the morning I turn on the computer and an email from Todd Breitenfeldt pops up.  Todd has bolstered the struggling biological weed control project in Whitehall, Montana for a number of years now.  His once-a-year email announces it is time to come and pick up a supply of flea beetles.  This is the moment gloom lifts and sunlight floods in.
You may have to be a Montanan to understand the significance of flea beetles, though Dakotans probably qualify and perhaps country people in Idaho and Washington.  The situation is this.  An invasive plant, leafy spurge, accidentally introduced from Eurasia in the 1800's, is a scourge of the arid West.  Pioneer women longing for a spot of color in a dismal landscape took a fancy to the bright green stalks covered with yellowish-green bracts.  They planted it in gardens to cheer themselves up.  Once let loose, leafy spurge ran rampant. It spread unwanted in pastures, meadows, and along irrigation canals out-competing hay and native grasses.  Cattle avoid it like the plague.  Cattle ranchers hate it.
I'm not a  rancher so my particular problem with leafy spurge takes a slightly different and somewhat gloomier slant.  Ranchers spray it with a powerful herbicide which kills everything it touches.  Good enough for cattle.  Not so good for bees or butterflies,warblers or hummingbirds.  This drives me crazy and makes me think the end is near.
Enter the flea beetle.  Flea beetles are welcome immigrants from Eurasia.  They eat leafy spurge.  They fly around happy as they can be gorging themselves on the slender leaves.  When their life's work is done and the spurge bends bare and helpless, the tiny, shiny black insects die, spent.  Before that though, they lay larvae which buries down into the leafy spurge roots.  Next year, more flea beetles.  
I believe in these flea beetles.  The first time Todd handed me a small, round cardboard container holding 10,000 crawling flea beetles, I was offended.  I was to reach my hand in, grab a leafy spurge spray to which they were clinging and distribute the beetles over the yellow-green umbils?  Not likely.  I shuddered, did as I was told, watched and waited as the weeks went by, and then the years.  Sure enough.  The spurge slowly disappeared.  A Darwinian miracle.
Now, the sunniest day of my country year is the day I release the flea beetles onto a patch of leafy spurge.  No poison.  Just a few of nature's loveliest creatures.  For a moment I stop brooding.  The end is not as near as I thought.

048765.txt,Schyler,,Under 18,"Buda, Texas","August 29, 2008",2008,Music Is the Answer to Life,creativity,"I believe that music is the answer to life. It is the antidote for all, may it be a bad day, a celebration, or just expressing sentiment.
But allow me to start with bad days. Everyone has them, but only the astute know the best way to heal them; music. I know that when I have bad days I grab my KC & the Sunshine Band CD and allow my problems to melt away as I jam to the sweet sound of Vinnie Tanno and Ken Faulk making sweet melodies on their trumpets. As Forest Gump's mother said, ""Life is like a box of chocolate; you never know what you're going to bite into next."" I like to consider music to be the wax paper that each of those pieces of chocolate is wrapped in. No matter which piece you do bite into, there is that wax paper, patiently waiting for you to spit out the nasty lemon cream filling, which few like, back into it. Just like no matter what life leaves at my front door, there is a song that can totally distract my mind, or even just give me that boost of courage to solve it. Or maybe I had a good day and music just helps emphasize it.
What would a celebration be without music? Not a celebration, that is for sure. Music enlightens the heart as jelly makes the peanut butter sandwich. Without music life is like gooey stuff on the roof of your mouth. Music is like the substance that takes away the goo. Like water, only ten thousand times better. Love for anniversaries, classical for baby showers, or whatever makes the mood joyful for those blissful occasions. 
Playing an instrument is one of the most perfect ways to express any emotion I might have bottled up inside. Be it happy, sad, angry, anxious, or just whatever my heart has going on at the time. It does not even really matter if I play well or not. For the most part some would say I need immense improvement, but honestly I do not care! It helps me solve problems I have, or just helps me cope with them. Who cares if the world cringes at the sound of the beat of my heart?
 Whatever the occasion or feeling, music can help. I believe that music is the answer to life.

048877.txt,Craig,,18 - 30,"East Brunswick, New Jersey","September 1, 2008",2008,The Importance of Advertising,popular culture,"Advertising is a core business function and necessary expenditure that can build and maintain strong brands.  I believe that advertising is essential for any organization with a product to sell or a service to offer.  It is, in fact, equally important as accounting, cost analysis, production, supply chain management, and sales.  Advertising also accounts for a substantial portion of our economy.  Companies spent nearly $150 billion on advertising in 2006 – in the United States alone.  However, advertising dollars are not always spent wisely; companies that receive a substantial return on their investment usually build strong brands and achieve high revenues.  However, a mismanaged campaign or misappropriated funds can drain capital from a company without offering any of the desired results.
	A company's products or services are ultimately rendered useless if nobody is aware of them; hence the need to advertise.  Advertising, however, is a subtle science; a craft that fails more often that it succeeds.  It is very difficult to reach a consumer, especially in this modern digitized era of TiVo and digital recorders.  Consumers have an innate sense of what is important to them and what they can disregard – a wall of selective perception that only allows certain messages to even breach the mind.  It is the advertiser's responsibility to crack this barrier, reach the consumer, and preach a product's benefits or attributes – all within a thirty second spot or on one single sheet of paper. 
	Yet without advertising, we would not have the brands with which we are so familiar today, such as Coca-Cola and Apple.
	Coca-Cola, for instance, had enjoyed a leading market share in the United States for years, until taste tests in the early 1990s revealed a preference for the sweeter Pepsi.  Coke panicked, and hastily created ""New Coke"" to match Pepsi's taste-testing advantage.  However, consumers responded negatively, and Coke was forced to rebrand its original formula as ""Coke Classic,"" to the relief of millions of loyal consumers.  Coke quickly learned that the strength of the company lay not in the taste of its product, but more or less in the consumer's attachment to the brand itself.  Decades of strong advertising and useful taglines crafted Coke's rock-solid image.
	Apple has also used advertising to thrust itself at the forefront of the laptop computer market.  Macs had always enjoyed an advantage over other personal computers in terms of graphics and multimedia, but they had not used the right advertising to exploit these advantages.  The current campaign portrays Macs as trendy, modern, and intelligent, while other personal computers are assumed to be outdated and useless.  And consumers have responded: Macs are now the most popular laptop computer on college campuses.  
	These two brands have clearly used advertising to forge specific identities, allowing them to maintain a loyal fan-base while continually attracting new consumers.
	Advertising is a core business function which, if used correctly, can build brands and maintain a brand's strength over time.  It is expensive, but necessary, and is undoubtedly vital to the success of any business-to-business or business-to-consumer company.

048920.txt,Devin,,18 - 30,"Belle Mead, New Jersey","September 2, 2008",2008,Art Helps Us Discover Ourselves,creativity,"I believe that expression through art is one of the crucial ways in which we define who we are as a person.  In many ways art is part of what makes us human.  I do acknowledge the fact that many people don't practice conventional methods of art such as painting and sculpting.  I feel that this is a rather old-fashioned view.  I believe that art is anything that is done in which there is a deeper meaning that what lies on the surface.  In this respect everyone is an artist.  When they pour their heart and soul into something they do it becomes a work of art.  
As for myself, I find expression through film.  As a Television, Radio and Film major I take classes that involve the theory and practice behind film making.  I love the various aspects that go into it.  Writing the script, choosing the actors, picking the best shots, all of it is something I have a great passion for.  Through this drive and enthusiasm I am able to give the whole experience a deeper meaning that merely what the film is about, or the technical aspect of how it's made.  When others watch the films I hope that they too will take from it something more than just its face value.  Each one of my films is something I take great personal pride in.  I draw upon personal experiences to help connect with my audience.  
I find that as I continue to practice my skills I get, not only enjoyment out of it, but I also feel as if I better understand myself.  As I express my artistic side I discover a piece of my own humanity.  I believe everyone is capable of this.  I believe that everyone does express themselves artistically in one form or another.  Almost everyone has something that they do which they find has a deeper mean to it.  This is their art and this is how they discover part of who they are.

	I believe I may be depressed. At times I feel as though I could pass away and nobody would stop. I've always been an honor roll student, an AP kid, an athlete, a popular friend. These altered as I entered high school. Giving them up never seemed part of my plan, but I guess that's just what happens when you grow up. School gets harder, eventually at least a little effort is required. You realize your friends aren't real friends. You experience the sporadic pang of loneliness.
I'm not sure when I lost touch with my close friends, or why I decided to stop playing soccer. I'm not sure where I lost my self confidence. I'm not sure how I decided to feel sorry for myself on a daily basis, without a legitimate reason. I have no idea when I lost touch with the world, or more importantly myself.
	I'm overwhelmingly humble, but here it goes. I'm not half bad looking. I am blonde, blue-eyed. I am tall. Though I may not be model material, I will always have my academic background. I have no idea what a college prep course is like. My mouth, remaining closed when I know the answer to a question in class, is full of straight and white teeth that have never come in contact with a full set of braces. I don't judge people, I hold the door for strangers, and I always leave a decent tip. I laugh at jokes that aren't funny. And though I'm never vocal about it, I love the people I'm close to with every ounce of my being and soul.
	I hate myself. I get upset looking in mirrors, I cry everyday after school. I tell myself I'll never get into the college of my dreams, that my family will stop loving me after a while, it's simply inevitable.  I compare myself with every adolescent, and wish to trade lives with the person sitting next to me in Physics class. I interrogate my boyfriend constantly, wondering why he loves me. My dreams of becoming a writer will never become reality, because I am me.
	And if I am depressed, if I do have chemical imbalances in my brain, oh well. Tonight I saw a shooting star, and I wasn't over-weight, my GPA wasn't as bad as I thought it was. I made a wish and whispered it quietly. In that moment I wasn't inadequate, I was alive. These moments that make me realize my true self- the 17 year old growing closer to some unknown adult figure. If it's not a graduate of New York University that moves on to become a published writer, I am open to the other fate that God has for me.  That is, if my wish comes true.

049226.txt,Brian,,Under 18,"remus, Michigan","September 8, 2008",2008,science v. religion,science,"Science vs. Religion 
	Now let me start by saying that, yes, I did grow up in a very religious family. We went to church every Sunday and I went to a Catholic school until I was in the sixth grade. However, even during this time I still from time to time questioned certain things that were being taught to me that religion stated as being true. When I would ask my teachers at school how this was they would as me why I would even ask that question and tell me that ""thoughts are the kind of questions that should never be asked."" 
	Once I started junior high I determined that not everything that had been taught to me as a child was true. For instance most of the things referenced in the Bible. Such as the Earth being created in just seven days. I have to side with science on that one just because I have tried to think about this in from a religious point of view but…then I have thoughts, and if you have thoughts like I do there are a lot of gaps that religion fails to fill in. However, I do still think that the lessons and morals shown in the Bible are a good reference for many people. Like being kind to each other and helping the less fortunate. That's why the church sends out the collection basket right. I don't think however that we are really helping the poor by throwing money at them. That isn't going to motivate them to get a job and start helping their own people that just puts in thire mind that they don't need to get a job because the Americans will just keep sending us food and money.
	Evolution is another big controversy between science and religion. Now the Bible says that ""God created everything including the fist two people, and they had two sons and from there, there is this really big gap of time. What happened during this time the Bible fails to mention, but suddenly there are all kinds of people. Now they just went from four people, three boys and one girl. Now if you ask me there was some incest going on there after the garden, which the Bible says is WRONG. 
	These are just some of the experiences that have changed the way I view religion and the things that most religions say. Because I have really no religious side I have found that science can fill in the gaps that religion has left out. 
	With the problem of the poor people with no food, science is finding new ways to grow more drought resistant plants and plants that can grow more food on one plant. Through the process of changing the genetic make up of plants, scientists are finding better ways to help people in, say, Africa and places that are typically not suited to grow plants where they normally wouldn't be able to grow plants.

I didn't like to talk to my teachers, or my friends parent's, I kept to myself. When I got to middle school, this was an issue for me. All the girls seemed so comfortable being loud and crazy, how could they act like that in front of everyone? I was very easily embarrassed, which is why I didn't say much, I never wanted to say the wrong thing. I looked down when I walked, barely said hi to people in the hallways, and never looked teachers in the eye. I was a scared little girl, quiet and shy. I never knew why I would get so embarrassed over saying hello to someone in the hallway. I thought a lot about what other people thought. I never wanted the attention on me, I didn't want to have to try and impress anyone. I dressed very plainly, wore my hair very simple, and was just there. I liked to be invisible because it was just easier for me.
My friends were kind of loud and crazy, but I was still the quiet one. I just sat back and watched, it was funny. I never had to be involved in the craziness, until I met Devin. Devin loved the way she looked; she was so friendly and outgoing. I envied the way Devin didn't have to think about what people thought; it was like she just knew everyone liked her. Over the next few years in middle school Devin helped me come out of my shell. She showed me what it was like to be myself, and if people didn't like me for the person I was, that was their loss. 
Then high school came and I wished I were invisible again. I climbed back into my hermit shell and stayed quiet. I still hung out with my friends and had fun with them, but I wasn't the same around people I didn't know. Once again I cared about what they thought, if they were looking at me, and why they were looking at me. Finally, Devin confronted me about it, ""Why are you always so quiet?"" she asked. I told her I didn't know why, I was just insecure. I told her wished I could have the confidence she had, and have no insecurities. She told me her secret, and it seemed so simple. She said to me, ""Elise, I have more insecurities than you will ever know. But I don't think about that, because I believe in myself. Just believe in yourself, don't care what other people think, the only one that matters is you."" I have followed that statement with all of my heart since then.

""Money makes the world go round!"" is the quote I would always hear from time to time on TV. I would always think to myself that this was definitely not true, of course, I was younger then. I thought as long as you had your family and love, everything will be okay in life. Now that I am nineteen years old, and a college student working part time with credit card bills, car maintenance fees, car insurance, cell phone bill, tuition costs, books, and not to mention gas, I have finally come to realize the value of a dollar. I started working at the age of sixteen at a restaurant nearby and I found myself making about $300 a week working only three or four days a week. This was a lot of money to me. I had no bills to pay then so what would I do with my money? Spend it of course! Instead of being smart and saving I let the money vanish before my eyes. About two months of me working and living what I thought ""the life"", without any financial worries, my mom told me, ""Moni wouldn't you want to have a car of your own?"" Back then I would drive my mom's car or my dad's truck, I thought to myself for a minute. Wow that would be nice to have my own car, so I told her, ""Yeah Mom I really would want to! That would be super cool!"" So my mom said, ""If you can save up for your car until next summer I will help you get your car"". This was very good news for me! I finally began saving all my money and within a year I ended up buying my first car! After I bought my car I continued with my bad habits of spending money irresponsibly again. I worked at the restaurant for 2 more years and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. Now I find myself struggling through life living off of paycheck to paycheck from my part time job trying to pay off only my necessities.
Money may not make the world go round but it is essential. You can not have a roof over 
your head, feed yourself and family, and go through life without any money. Money may not be able to buy you happiness, but it will provide for you and your family and help you live better. This world I live in now is completely different then the one I lived when I was sixteen, which was basically provide for me and just buy whatever I wanted and go out and have fun. Now I feel like I have entered the real world which is trying to survive from my paychecks, helping out my family, and yet still trying to live a little. This is why I believe money is essential to survive in the world I live in.

The harsh reality around me never made me much of a dreamer. Dreams are nothing more than reconstructions of events in real life anyways; sometimes your own personal life, sometimes that of those around you. The big dreamers have aspirations to be rich and famous, like the people on TV.  My only dream was to survive to see the next day.
I've always lived in a single parent home. I lived with my mom until I was 7. Then, I became a burden on her so she had me move in with my dad. My dad worked all day, and by the time he came home to our studio apartment, I would be asleep. At 8 years old, I had to learn the survival skills of an adult. I had to learn to cook, wash my own clothes, and dress myself, which wasn't always easy. My lack of adult supervision allowed me to stay outside till late everyday playing marbles and mimicking pro wrestling. While most kids grew up with nature and nurture, I only had nature groom me. It is this lonely upbringing that made me the individualist I am today.
	Deciding what college I would attend was the most difficult decision I've had to make. During the week leading up to national signing day, I had narrowed my decision to CAL and University of Arizona. Everyone expected me to choose Arizona because I would have a better chance in making it to the NFL from there. But in my process of making a decision, I had started to heavily consider my academic career. My appearance and decision on signing day shocked everyone that I knew. I came, wearing a CAL cap, to sign my intent to attend UC Berkeley, the nation's number one public university.
	So what is it exactly that I believe in? I believe in the power of the individual and how much the individual controls his own destiny. If my experience has taught me anything, it's that you have to create your own opportunities because just dreaming doesn't do anything for you.

050026.txt,Sanford (,,65+,"State College, Pennsylvania","September 21, 2008",2008,This I Believe,education & knowledge,"I believe in books—or, rather, the opportunity that books provide to help us better understand the natural world around us and the people who inhabit it.
I feel fortunate to have grown up in a home full of books. My parents, both teachers, had a library with all sorts of books, including complete editions of the works of such authors as James Fenimore Cooper, Charles Dickens, Washington Irving, and Robert Louis Stevenson. While attending school and spending time with my friends, I also inhabited a world of imagination fostered by reading the novels of these and other authors.  I feel I owe my sensitivity to issues of class and the plight of the downtrodden, for instance, by being exposed in my childhood to the absorbing stories and unique characters that Dickens created.
In college I gradually moved more toward nonfiction, though it was the fiction and plays of Jean-Paul Sartre that got me interested in existentialism and prompted me to major in philosophy.  I had inspiring teachers in people like Walter Kaufmann and Richard Rorty, who supervised my senior thesis on Sartre, and they inculcated in me a deep respect for the world of ideas.
Knowing I did not have the dramatic flair that I believed necessary to become a first-rate teacher on the model of my own father or Walter Kaufmann, I found a home in publishing that well suited my interests and strengths.  Unlike graduate school, where I had experienced the pressure to narrow one's horizons so as to become an expert in a certain subfield, publishing allowed me to be a dilettante and to get paid for it.
My roots in liberalism had engrained in me a strong belief in the ""marketplace of ideas,"" and as an acquiring editor I dedicated myself to championing the best academic writing I could find, irrespective of political orientation. Thus, over the years, I have published books reflecting arguments from across the political spectrum, from conservative to liberal to socialist, in the firm belief that, as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., once put it, ""the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.""
I worry that the rush to digitize everything in sight and put it up on the Web will exacerbate the problems already identified in the NEA's 2004 report on ""Reading at Risk.""  As Web researcher Jakob Nielsen has observed, ""the Web is perfect for narrow, just-in-time learning of information nuggets—so long as the learner already has the conceptual framework in place to make sense of the facts.""  The younger generation, weaned on the Web, is in danger of losing the ability to develop such conceptual frameworks, which comes from in-depth, concentrated reading of books where arguments can be laid out in a logical progression.  And the marketplace of ideas is already, as demonstrated in the current election campaign, degenerating into a marketplace of sound bites, where ideas get neatly packaged in blacks and whites, leaving all the greys unacknowledged. The citizens of this country desperately need the rich contexts that books can provide to assess what the candidates are telling us. And that is one reason I volunteered to help the Centre Daily Times keep its book review section alive, so as to bring to the attention of people in central Pennsylvania the wealth of knowledge that books of general interest published by university presses can provide. With our partners in the Penn State Bookstore and Schlow Library, we can hope that this effort will succeed in providing our fellow citizens with more ideas to help them better understand why sound bites usually only tell half-truths.

Being happy because of possessions or fame doesn't provide true happiness, it provides fake happiness. 
During my senior year in high school I thought I was living the good life. I was a star on the football team, everyone at my high school knew me, and I had the best friends in the world. I was being recruited by big schools to play football, and I was one of the most widely known athletes in my county. 
Midway through football season something happened that changed my life. I broke my fifth metatarsal (the worst bone in your foot to beak) and my football career ended.
I didn't know what happened. I was living the good life and in one moment my ""good life"" was over. I still had the friends and the popularity but my high school football career was over. I didn't realize that I hadn't actually been living the ""good life"" until I started getting closer to her.
When I broke my foot I felt like my life was over and I didn't even want to go to school, but, I had the incredible fortune of sitting next to the best looking girl in the school, Coree, in my first class. Before I broke my foot she and I were friends, but after I broke my foot we started getting closer. 
Over the next couple weeks Coree and I started becoming almost best friends and I started not feeling sad for myself. I even got to a point where I forgot about my foot because I was enjoying being around Coree. I wondered to myself why hadn't I been like this before I got hurt. Now, when my football career had ended, I was happier than when I was meeting college football coaches daily.
That's when it hit me. Before I got hurt I was living the ""good life"" through fake happiness. I thought my popularity and small time fame made me happy. But I was wrong; the only thing that could truly make me happy was being around someone who didn't want to be my friend just because of my football abilities. Coree wanted to be my friend for who I was, not who I was as an athlete. The things I thought brought me happiness before my injury were just place holders for real happiness, they had no real value and were not fulfilling like being around Coree was. 
Now that I could see what true happiness felt like I never wanted to let it go. Nothing ever really gets to me anymore, sometimes things get me down but those feelings pass quickly. I'm able to stay happy because I've made more friends like Coree, friends who like me for who I am, and are there for me whenever I need them. I'm able to be happy with these people instead of being happy with my small time fame.

050455.txt,Connor,,Under 18,"Western Springs, Illinois","September 28, 2008",2008,"Reading, only for school",education & knowledge,"Reading, Only for School
	Many people think reading is a relaxing activity.  Some people love to read on the beach while others would rather cozy up with a book in their bed.  For me reading is a waste of time.  I gain no joy from reading a ""great book"".  Reading is dull and uneventful.  Give me a TV or a laptop; for Pete's sake give me a puzzle.  I will do nearly anything to entertain myself besides read.  I believe that reading is meant to stay at school.
	I am a part of a generation that loves to watch three TV shows at the same time, while doing tonight's geometry homework.  Our generation's greatest punishment is to have to sit in one seat and listen to one person for an hour straight.  Coming from this generation, I simply don't have the patience, or the will power to read a book for no reason other than pleasure.  Don't get me wrong I think reading is vital to a person's education, because it allows us to learn about past historical battles and our world. But I think that is all reading is good for.  
	For some people reading is a way to learn, and is a form of enjoyment.  To fill up my leisure time I rather do something more exciting.  For example, while someone is reading that gushy love story about vampires they could be watching the exact same thing on TV.  Watching the TV would be much easier and would provide crystal clear picture of vampires with aching hearts.  I would much rather go play basketball than read about someone doing the exact same thing. 
	Reading often talks about things that I could be doing in real life.  Playing a sport is much more exciting and fulfilling to me than reading about the sports past.  Getting exercise and being active is better to me than staying cooped up inside all day reading line after line, page after page.  After about ten minutes of good reading, the words begin jump all over the page and seem to have lives of their own.  I simply can't read any longer without losing my mind.  One of the main reasons I hate reading when I don't have to is because I see reading as a symbol for school.  To me school is a pressure filled building with tests and quizzes ready to make your brain hurt.  In my free time I don't want to have to think about school, I just want to ""forget the world"".
	Overall reading is one of the most boring things anyone can do, and symbolizes the most hated place on earth to kids.  Maybe my brain will rot after watching TV instead of reading, but that is a chance I am willing to take.  Because I truly believe that reading for enjoyment is dull and a waste of time.

050513.txt,Siobhan,,18 - 30,"Seattle, Washington","September 29, 2008",2008,Finishing the Race,self-determination;sports,"One step over that finish line and I burst into tears.  I fell to my knees and kissed the medal that had been placed around my neck.  It was, without a doubt, an extremely melodramatic display of my emotion.  But I had accomplished something that I was not sure would be possible… at the age of eighteen, I had run the Marine Corps Marathon.  
Sure the training had kept me in shape through the first few months of my freshman year of college, kept me on a schedule, and allowed me to see the sites of DC while many of my other friends stayed glued to campus- but it also afforded me an emotional escape and a time of reflection that I may not have sought out otherwise.  Three hours is a long time.  A long time to spend alone with yourself every Sunday.  A long time to listen to your thoughts and to your body.  A long time to analyze decisions, actions, and an uncertain future- and to develop a sense of self that can be hard to pinpoint in the bustling world around us.  Sometimes it seemed like moving was the only way to stand still.
Running became, in those few months, an integral piece of my livelihood.  It was not, however, until three years later that I was given the words behind the power of what I was experiencing through running.  Two years after this marathon, during my third year of college, I began training a good friend for a half marathon.  She had not run more than 3 miles in her life before the training began, and so she, much more than I, needed words of encouragement to finish those miles.  She wanted to finish that race, perhaps even more than I did.  I had run 7 half marathons in the past few years- leaving me with the illusion that this race was somehow less of an accomplishment.  
One morning, while running an eight-mile training run, she said the words to me that have become more a part of me than perhaps any phrase in the world.  ""There will be a day when we can not do this…"" she said, ""but today is not that day."" That was it.  That was everything I had ever felt about running in one sentence.  Running was power.  It was opportunity.  And it was proof that I could and would do something great- even if it were only to finish that run.  It was a promise.  This I believe, that the most important belief in the world is an interminable belief in yourself.

050615.txt,Natasha,,Under 18,"46218, Indiana","September 30, 2008",2008,This I Believe,creativity;popular culture;self-knowledge,"I believe in music and poetry because music is a universal language that is understood around the world. The power of poetry is that it is a way to release the emotion within you without doing something illegal. When music and poetry crosses over in to spoken word you get a combination that can change the world if not more. Music was introduced to me before I was born. 
         My first words were the lyrics to Lauren Hills- Killing me softly. I began writing poetry when I was eight years old. It was my vent for my mothers drug problem. When my great grand mother died it was my way of getting through a tough time in my life. 
        The same a when my uncle and aunt died. Music has so much more then a beat that can make you bob your head. Music has emotion. Music can make you feel what the artist was going through at the time the song was written.
          A song can teach you a lesson the easy way without actually having to go through it. A song can make you happy for the rest of the day. Poetry can do the same because the words in poetry can be put to a beat and both of them together is music. Music can trigger a past memory, and for me it dose a lot.
          I can be in the car and a song would come on that would remind me of a past boyfriend, or a song my grandmother use to sing in the church choir. That's why I love music and it lives though me.

It's what got me to become me. Dance has been the thing that made me crack out of my shell and show people the real, loud, outgoing me.
	When I was little I was kind of a shy kid. Not around my friends or family, but around anyone I didn't know. But when I was five I started dance classes at Rhythm and Shoes Dance. Every Wednesday night at 6 o'clock, I would go to my class and learn little dances. I didn't talk much to the other girls, because I didn't know them. There was only one girl I talked to, her name was Emily. She was shy kind of like me. Week by week we learned more and me and Emily only talked to each other.
 Then the recital night came. The night where everyone's family or friends came to watch their sons or daughters dance on that big black stage in front of hundreds of people. Classes of dancers pasted and it was soon my classes turn to go on that stage and show everyone our dances we have been working on for almost a year! We slowly walked out and then the curtains opened, and the music started. Our dance teachers where on the side behind the curtains doing the dance in case we forgot a dance move and we could just look over and see what to do. I started the dance my teacher had taught me and that was the very moment I realized, I'm a good dancer. I didn't look at my teacher once! 
	The next year I took another class, a harder one, and I talked to almost my entire class every week.
	Year after year I danced and I began to become more outgoing and became myself! I would dance randomly because I felt good about myself. I didn't care anymore about what people thought about my dancing. It was my passion and that's all I cared about. 
It wasn't just at my dance classes where I was becoming myself. It was at school, church, or anywhere I was at anytime. 
 	I didn't care who was around me or where I was. I would dance and I didn't care who saw me. Dancing made me feel good and I loved doing it.
	Dancing for me isn't just a fun activity to do in my spare time, it is what has made my life MY life. Dancing as though no one is watching has made me, ME. 
	My friends love me for who I am and it is because I am so outgoing and I dance and don't care what people think. I dance and I love it. That is all that matters to me.
	Many people have many beliefs, but I believe to dance like no one is watching because it made my life what I want it to be.

051252.txt,Kevin,,Under 18,"Hot Springs, Arkansas","October 14, 2008",2008,My Love for the Sport,self-determination,"My Love for the Sport
     Have you ever had something that you truly love to do?  Something that you would rather do than anything else in the world?  Have you ever set a major goal for that thing?  This thing for me is swimming.  Since I started, I knew that I was dedicated to this sport.  I feel that everyone has something that they truly enjoy doing.  As Ray Bradbury said, ""If you don't love something, then don't do it.""  He's right, why do something you don't love?  This is what motivates me in the pool.
     One day last year, on the day of the Arkansas State Championship Meet, I jumped into the pool for warm-ups.  I had a feeling inside that I was going to do something great.  As I got out of warm-ups, I began to feel nervous in my seat.  I listened to my ipod as I focused on the race ahead of me.  I could feel the cold, brisk wind blow past my face.  The water splashed like pieces of ice being shattered on concrete.  I became one with the crowd, with the building, with the air and the pool.  I was unstoppable.  As my race came closer and closer, I went to talk to my coach.  I said ""It is time to get my Junior National cut.""  She agreed.  With that I said ""Anything else?""  She said ""Get out fast and bring it home!""  After that I approached the chairs where the finalists sit.  I could tell that people's minds were racing as they moved around and talked to each other, but I was still and silent, focused on the task ahead.  We stood up and began to approach the blocks while the entrance song was played.  The announcer said everybody's name and the whistle was blown.  We stepped onto the blocks.  ""Take your mark.""  Beep.  I jumped in ahead.  As we swam down the pool, I got farther and farther away from my competition.  As I flip-turned, I was ahead.  Now I knew nobody could catch me.  All I wanted was that Junior Cut!  As I got close to the end, the crowd was roaring.  I pushed as hard as I could to the finish.  As I touched, I looked up to see if I had made it or not.  I had gotten the winter junior cut, but not the summer one.  I was still happy and I received a gold medal later for winning.
     As I looked back on that race, I realized what it took to get me there.  It took pain beyond belief, main practice sets that were ridiculously brutal, soreness from head to toe,  not enough sleep, having to eat all of the right foods and waking up extremely early for practice. I was exhausted from stress, soreness, hard work and sleep deprivation.  I was pushed to the limit every week, just trying to survive until the last practice was over, then it would start all over again.  Dedication is the key to success. Without it I can achieve nothing.  Again, Ray Bradbury's words resound through me.  ""I know you've heard it a thousand times before.  But it's true-hard work pays off.  If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice.  If you don't love something, then don't do it.""
     I can relate to what Bradbury said.  Every summer while my friends in Hot Springs are having fun, I am in Little Rock training.  Two-a-days, weights, dry land training, fast-paced sprint sets, and long aerobic sets are drilled into us.  I hear about all of the fun things that my friends are getting to do over the summer, but I would still rather be in the pool training for something better.  It is hard work that gets us through life.  Without it I don't know what I would do.
     I say all of these things to inspire you toward something that you love.  Be proud of the work that it takes to be great at something.  When you decide to do something, fully commit to it.  Commit your mind, body and soul to your dreams and desires.  Making sacrifices on a daily basis may not seem exciting at the time, but in the long run, these are the times that will matter the most.

051486.txt,Anthony,,Under 18,"Granite Falls, North Carolina","October 16, 2008",2008,I believe there is a God,faith & religion,"This I Believe
I believe there is a God
I've always said that I've been going to church since nine months before I was born. I've gone to a few different churches in my life. But there is one concept I will hold on to. That's my faith, so I am here to say: I believe there is a God.
I think God can work in the most mysterious ways. I think that the Bible is the direct word of God, and should be taken literally. I take the Bible at its word, and am scared of the wrath of God. But I also think that God is loving and merciful.
When you look at Christianity, most people think that it's merely believing that Christ is God's son. It's, in reality, much more than that. It's following Christ. A lot of people say that it is all based on faith. They would be correct.  In Hebrews 11:3 it says, ""3By faith we understand that the entire universe was formed at God's command, that what we now see did not come from anything that can be seen."" The Bible says in Hebrews 11:1, ""1Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen; it gives us assurance about things we cannot see."" 
I try to express faith in my life all the time.  I make it known that I am a Christian.  I do not hold back my belief.  I remember one time; I was working in one of my classes.  Then a junior came up to me.  Supposedly the junior had heard that if there was anyone that would know where something was in the Bible, it would be me.  This isn't necessarily true.  But she came up to me and asked me if I knew where something was in the Bible.  I have to admit that I had no clue whatsoever.  But it made me feel good that the fact that I am strong in my faith got to a junior.
So there you go. If everyone would just make their own decisions, then maybe the world would be more interesting. I will always believe that Jesus is God's son and died for us. So I say, I BELIEVE THERE IS A GOD!!!!

I remember dancing the night away after we were crowned ""Prince and Princess 2006."" I remember hugging him in my cheer uniform when we were celebrating winning the football championship in 2006 and him breaking the rushing record. I remember holding his hand as we walked to our seats before our graduation ceremony, both of us beaming with bright futures. I also remember walking to his casket to say my last good-byes so hurt, confused, and in shock.
Nathan as a special part of who I am today and unfortunately, I never got to tell him because his life was taken in a car accident at age 19. I hit an ultimate low in my life after this horrifying accident but I am accepting what happened even if the road to happiness is grueling.
A few days after the funeral I stood at Nathan's grave and I cried until my head hurt and after 10 minutes of this a memory of Nathan crossed my mind and I let out a giggle through the tears which was probably the work of my friend who was infamous for being the joker. At that moment an epiphany hit me. All I have is time. And I better use it.
All I could think of was to use my time doing everything Nathan wasn't able to. I spend too much time going through the motions of life and not using my time wisely. I called my brother Ryan who is a manager at Cabelas and I told him I wanted to learn how to shoot a bow, go on an elk and swan hunting trip with him, learn how to duck call and fly fish.
The next bucket list to do was finding a friend to go sky diving with me in Crete Nebraska and thankfully my friend Ashley promises she'll be here in May to take the leap with me. I want everyone in Saline County to hear me yell ""this one's for you buddy!""
I also can not keep promising my ailing 80 year old Grandma that I'll be out to see her ""sometime."" because there is no ""sometime."" I am hoping there is a school break coming up in a week or two and that will do. I can not wait to ask her 1,000 questions about the olden days and really listen to her stories.
I don't want to make unrealistic goals. I just want to indulge in all the simple things that life gives us which I unfortunately took for granted during my 20 years. I want to walk in the country during harvest time and see farmers driving tractors with all of the beautiful colors. I want to say I love you's , get two angel  wings tattooed on my shoulder , give an important speech , read books , save a life as a nurse and someday bring a human life into this world. I want to feel alive because my special friend can't and the fact that I can is the greatest gift.
I want everyone in my situation to know that it is OK to hurt , to cry or scream but taking the hurt and doing something exciting with it is the best counseling. I refuse to sit around thinking about how unfair it is that my friend isn't with me anymore and wallow in grief. Nathan and I will meet again but I can not sit around waiting until that wonderful day because ""all I have is time!""

052101.txt,Sean,,Under 18,"Missouri City, Texas","October 22, 2008",2008,Success,self-knowledge,"Ever since high school started, grades were one of the most important obstacles to over come. Grades determine a person's ranking in high school and what college he or she can get into. Many people believed that high school is a stepping-stone that sets the foundation of a person's future and that if a person does not do well, they would not be able to do well in life.
	I have made decent grades throughout high school. They are neither low nor high, they are above average. Many people would have cried when they get above average grades but I do not. I have found out that grades do not always bring a person success in life.
	I believe that happiness can bring success in life. When I take a major-grade test, I would usually stress over and over about the test and believe that it is going to be hard. When the test grade came out, the grade was not as suspected. After I had come home from school, I would not tell my parents about the grade. After my parents had found out about my grades they would not yell or scream about it. Compared to some of my friends, their parents would get mad if they made one lousy grade. My parents would say, ""You did a great job."" I was shocked at their response. I knew there was something that they knew that I did not know. When I asked them why they would not get mad, responded by saying that there is more than one way to be successful. They then talked about all the different ways to be successful. After all of the explanations, I summed up that happiness could guide a person to success.
	Happiness has taught me not to falter when I cannot find a way to solve my problem. I learned my problems would be solved if I would not think about the negative part and just concentrate in the positive part. Happiness has guided my life very well and I believe that it can help me in the future.
	Whenever I am happy, everything seems to be going the way I desire. The reason is that when I am in the happy mode, every negative thought is disposed of and is not reminded. If I am in the happy mode I can do many things efficiently and rarely falter. If for some reason I falter, I would just believe that I could overcome this situation because life does not end with one mistake and that there are other obstacles in life.

I believe in the salty taste of tears streaming down my face when my entire body aches, but I just will not allow myself to stop.  I believe in working so hard that the blood, sweat, and tears are merely symptoms of hard work and have no effect in my present state.  Like a cake without frosting, working hard without blood, sweat, and tears leaves a feeling of absence like something essential is missing.  I believe in blood, sweat, and tears.
Some people think I am lucky.  The truth is it has nothing to do with luck, but rather my competitive attitude and willingness to work hard in all aspects of my life.  There may be someone more talented than I am, but I can guarantee anyone that no one works harder than I do. I believe the harder I work, the luckier I get.  
I hate to admit this, but I did not always value hard work.  From the time I was born through my childhood years I always wanted everything to be handed to me on a silver platter, like a princess.  All of that gradually changed as I matured.  In seventh grade I was told that if I worked hard enough, I could have my college paid for through a basketball scholarship.  This was when I first started playing, and I had no skill other than raw talent and God-given abilities.  Since college was still years away it seemed possible that I could catch up with other players my age that had already been developing their basketball skills for years before I even started.  Through the kindness and patience of my dedicated basketball trainer, Kenny Drake, I spent countless hours every day for more than a year working on every aspect of basketball.  In the beginning, it was something I dreaded.  I remember moments when my dad would have to drag me to a workout despite my numerous excuses as to why I should not go.  In the end, my excuses were a waste of time and effort. Three months into the first year of my basketball workouts, I had an epiphany.  I realized it did not matter how hard I worked if I had a negative attitude.  If I truly hated what I was doing, how could I ever improve?  Having a positive attitude and working hard go hand in hand.  Once I changed my attitude towards my basketball workouts, my improvement skyrocketed.  I became one of the top girl's basketball players in the nation.  I was recruited and offered scholarships by countless different Universities across America.  Because of this success, I believe in all of the blood, sweat, and tears I had to endure to be where I am today.

Granted, much of society thinks that social workers either work with children (and their families) or the welfare system, but the spectrum of people that we (as social workers) interact with, is much broader. 
I work primarily with the older adult population in a hospital setting. This is not easy work. I assist individuals and families in making some of the hardest decisions that they will ever have to make in their lives. I am asked questions and hear remarks like: ""Mom can't take care of herself, but we aren't able to stay home with her, because we need to continue to work. What do we do?"" or ""I am not ready to go into a nursing home. I want to go to my own home."" or ""Dad always said that he didn't want to be hooked up to tubes, but I don't know if I am ready to give up yet.""
We as social workers do not stand alone in the medical profession. It is an interdisciplinary approach, that includes an array of professionals to assist the individual and family, but not only in regards to their medical condition. As a social worker, we work with the individual and family by educating them on their options and supporting and advocating for the plan that will ensure the least restrictive environment for that person, but always focusing on safety and the ability of that individual to make their own decisions if able.
Frankly, all job duties aside, one thing as become clear to me……Listen. Too many times as a society, we get wrapped up in the bottom line, and don't hear what the older generations are trying to tell us. My job is fast paced, so I know that there are times when I may spend less time listening, and more time trying to get my point across, but I have been humbled by this job. The most rewarding part of my job is when I am able to sit down beside them and listen to their story. Sometimes it may not seem relevant to a discharge plan, but I have learned, it is always relevant. 
Regardless of age, people want to be heard. They want to be seen as an individual that have given to this world, not someone that is seen as a burden. Sometimes that time spent listening to their story will be the highlight of their day, and holds more weight then we can even imagine. 
Yes, there are tough decisions to be made in life, some of the hardest when it comes to end of life, and education and preparation are essential to my job. However, I have found that learning about a person, and listening to them is the most important job qualification in human life.
I believe that listening is something that we were born to do, taking time to do it, is something that we chose.

I know a lot about Russia, the country I was born in. I know that there are so many superstitious beliefs that Russians don't even know half of them. For example, the most popular superstition: If a black cat crosses your way, you will have bad luck that day. Do you know what people do to avoid this bad luck? They will hold any buttons on their clothing, or they will spit three times over their left shoulder. I followed these rules, but actually nothing ever happened to me if a black cat crossed my way. I never had better luck if I held on to a button or spit three times over my left shoulder. Probably, if someone takes it to his attention and thinks about what happened to him during the day, he might have had a bad experience and relate the bad luck to the black cat; it's not the poor cat's fault that this cat happens to be born black.
A lot of these unreasonable beliefs are coming from the past, full of myths and superstitious beliefs. Humans always try to convince themselves by believing in superstitions that protect them from danger, risk, and to avoid negative situations.
In present times we know that superstitious beliefs are the viewpoints of the times past. My present opinion about these old stories and beliefs are that they are just foolishness of naive people. An accident, which broke my beliefs about superstition, was a time, when my mom was cooking in the kitchen. It was an early morning. I snuck into the kitchen like a spy to check on what my mom was cooking. Accidentally my mom broke a cup while she was washing the dishes.  In Russia we have a belief that if somebody breaks a dish, it will bring good luck and happiness. That is why my mom and I laughed about the broken dish. We decided that this would bring us luck today! Unfortunately this was not the case. I crawled back into my warm bed and decided to sleep just a little bit more. It was Saturday, a good day to sleep. I heard the phone ring and that's when my mom screamed! She cried out, ""Natasha! What has happened? What happened with Mom?"" Then she began crying.  Natasha was my grandmother's neighbor. She helped my grandmother around the house when we were away. She called my mom to tell her that my grandmother had passed away. I think that this was the second time in my life that I ever saw my mom cry. I was very upset that my grandmother had died. This was the moment in my life when I realized that all of this Mumbo Jumbo was false.
Everybody builds their ideas depending on their experience. Sometimes they fail or succeed at making a right or a wrong decision. It is foolish to base any beliefs off of superstitions that only have evidence from a few certain situations. There are other cultures that believe that black cats are good luck! This shows that superstitions are myths created by the culture and the people to deal with their fears and insecurities. I made my choice on how I view superstitions, and my grandmother's death helped me to realize that it doesn't matter what superstitions beliefs are. The most important thing that I believe is that my reality is based on the experiences and not myths that have fooled many people for long periods of history.

053068.txt,Caroline,,Under 18,"Wilmette, Illinois","November 4, 2008",2008,It is Your Choice,self-knowledge,"""Cough! Cough! I have a fever! I do not want to go to school,"" I nagged. My parents reluctantly agreed that I could skip school. I was as happy as the dry flowers when the rain poured on their dehydrated body. Every year I have an urge to repeat this sneaky act, but not this year. I realized that there is no advantage; it is just detrimental to me. I just lost a privileged day of learning.
Each day I go through many challenges and encounter many opportunities, but I always face one question: Why am I doing this? Hundreds of decisions are made. Most of them are made by our parents or pressured by our friends. Our reason for what we decide is not necessarily what we believe is correct, but truly how well someone persuaded us. We should make decisions because we want to improve ourselves as a better human being. 
At home or school, I witness many actions. When teachers request students to complete homework, some students think it is acceptable to have it incomplete. This act does not affect the teacher; it only hurts the student. Their actions should be instigated by their desire for development, not by the teachers' instruction. At home, my parents tell me to do my chores, but this is not a demand. It is a choice for me to consider. I always try to do the chores because it only educates me about life skills. Organization, responsibility, and obedience are taught; there are no drawbacks. 
 	One should be a ""good"" person anywhere, anytime. One day at swimming practice, we were using weights for a dry land workout. Afterwards, we were supposed to put them away in the crimson bucket located in the coaches' office. Many of the swimmers decided to leave them in the locker rooms instead, due to their laziness. On the other hand, I put mine in the right place. I did this not because the coach advised me to, but I did it because I knew that was the right thing to do.
When we returned to the locker room to change, I observed that there were still several weights. I put a few into the coaches' office and alerted him that there were still some left. I felt good afterwards and not guilty because I knew that my act was helpful. If I possess the power to do the righteous act, but fail to act properly, then I feel like a criminal. Life is not about completing what somebody tells you to do; life is about completing what will help you.
	I realize that everyday brings new opportunities and it gives you chances to improve yourself. Many people do not make their own decisions, but follow or do something because of pressure. They do not believe that life's opportunities are for their own good. I hope that someday, when people are mature, they will understand that life isn't about doing what people tell them to do; it is about doing something for the benefit of themselves and many other people who are affected by their action. So next time you want to skip school, think again.

053301.txt,Mke,,Under 18,"Auburn, Washington","November 7, 2008",2008,Words Can Hurt you,setbacks,"Words can't hurt is a controversial statement. Being criticized for your intelligence, race or even where you live, can hurt you physically or emotionally.  When I was little, people would tell me I was stupid and short. However, my teachers and family would tell me the exact opposite and say words cannot hurt me, but in reality, they did. Going to school everyday was fun most of the time until someone had to say something cruel.  I disagree with the statement words can't hurt, because in reality they do.  Why do people say words don't hurt, and how exactly are people hurt by those negative remarks?	
If words don't hurt, then why do African-Americans get mad when called ""negro""? All through middle school, I was called ""rat boy"" for some odd reason. One person told me it didn't matter because I didn't have to listen to them. It was hard to do this through my middle school life. It enraged me and I wanted to move away and go into a deep state of isolation. Finally in eighth grade, most of my peers saw that it made me angry and they quit. Over the years, my peers have changed. I got into my classes in high school and my life became pleasant once again. I met a guy in my history class that thought I was funny and we connected. Being African American, he is known as a ""Negro"" and knew how I felt when I was called ""rat boy"". I grew up being told negative thoughts about my size. 
Since words can hurt people, who started the whole false idea about how they don't hurt? Words can upset you physically or emotionally or you'll never forget what the assailant said to you. I remember back when I was in first grade, one of the other kids at recess called me small fry; he was older than me and thus bigger. I had rancor towards him that whole year, and I still do.  I was around seven when it happened, I'm seventeen now, and I still would be disgusted by that kid. In my case I was injured emotionally and I never forgot how much it hurt me. My size has not changed, but people now are different and don't vilify me anymore. 
All through my education at public schools, I have been ridiculed about my size. Being a junior and five foot four inches, I'm considered short. Out of all the names I was called, the two previously mentioned made me upset the most.  I'm writing about this to show that I have struggle with my self-esteem because of the names I was labeled.  What kind of advice should I be given to help with my struggling? I give advice to people just like me that words do hurt and it's insurmountable. People need to change in order for the remarks to stop completely. To conclude this writing assignment, I myself disagree with words can't hurt you because in truth they do.

I dwell on the anxiety I was feeling on the three-hour car ride north from the Twin Cities to Gooseberry State Park and the horrible feeling in my stomach, which I have been calling the ""icky butterflies"" since I was a little girl. 
These are the questions going through my mind: Will I ever find a decent man? How can I bring a man home when my roommate has a way better body and much cuter than I? What's the point in running so much if I can't get rid of this role of fat on my stomach? Why did Dennis dump me? Is it because he's smarter than I am? Is having a Master's Degree good enough? How could I afford a PhD? What if I get laid off in this economy? Oh God, what if I get laid off? Why do I feel so lonely? Why didn't I pack warmer clothes? Aren't 30-year olds supposed to have things figured out by now? Why do I feel like I'm going out of my mind?
I miss my dad on that car ride. ""Why did he have to be taken away from me at 18 years of age?"" I wonder what he would look like. I wonder if my Grandma would be happier if he was around. I wonder what my late teens would have been like with out the feeling of grief and loss. Would I have had more friends? Would I have finished school earlier and started on my career sooner?
When I arrive, my unease in the parking lot is not much better. I see all the dogs, families, and significant others and realize I'm going to be the freak hiking alone. 
	As I get on the path I hear nothing but the crunching of the recently fallen leaves on the path. The silence and stillness of the woods clears my head. I begin to realize that I am not alone. Red squirrels and chickadees are all around me. I notice a beaver's den in the river besides my trail and I wonder what is going on beneath the wood. I no longer feel alone. I no longer despise my body, as it is what is carrying me through this beautiful place. I feel a part of something so much bigger than myself. My anxieties begin to feel so small.	
As sit on the shore searching for agates, I see families doing the same in the distance and I feel an overwhelming sense of pride in myself for making this trip alone, for knowing how to take care of myself. I feel the presence of my father, as he is the one who taught me this sense of connection to nature and the faultless continuation of everything around me. 
	I contemplate what created all this around me. I come to the realization that I do not need to know. I'm not supposed to have things figured out. Much like my life. My ""icky butterflies"" have completely left me and I now feel a sense of serenity. I know in my heart that current of nature will always allow me to continuously grow emotionally and spiritually. With this realization, I believe that I can role with the difficulties of life much like the rocks in the waves on the shore where I sit.

It was a beautiful, warm sunny day when I walked up the block on November 4th to proudly give Barack Obama my vote toward what I hoped would be his victory.  It was mid-morning and I had assumed I had missed the wanted-to- be-first-in-line and pre-work voters' rush.  My heart jumped when I saw the beginnings of a line that I soon learned snaked around the block, and had done so since before the polls opened.  Never had I seen anything close to this; not during the excitement of the Hillary/Obama primary or the hopeful turnout for Gore versus W.
Getting on the subway, standing at the dangerous traffic intersection on my block and the check-out at the neighborhood supermarket, I'd witnessed daily the low tolerance in my hood for lines and waiting – unless, of course, it was for a free concert by Brooklyn neo-fav Erykah Badu.  But things on this line were beyond mellow with cells phones on fire with the buzz, and Obama shout-outs and honking horns from vans and cars passing by the line.
A once in a lifetime opportunity to be part of history –not just for America but the world –was the mode of the day. 
Watching the elderly Black women coming to vote on frail legs supported by walkers, canes and the kindness of strangers — the look of decades of struggle and broken dreams finally vindicated etched on their faces — brought tears to my eyes.  My mother was a sister to these Black women who no doubt were proudly coming out to voting places across America, determined to make their lifelong wishful dreams a reality.  No race advocate for sure, my mother has seen a lot in her 85 years, and had enthusiastically followed the drama of Obama's run from the beginning.  She had been so happy to have gotten her ballot in the mail in the nick of time to have her vote count.
I never had been happier in my Blackness.
And among the expected white and Black, older, middle-aged and college folks on line, there were all the young sisters and the young brothers, baggy jeans, baseball caps worn backwards and all!  Lil' Wayne -loving brothers proudly standing in line with their children.  All there to vote!
Something strong and wonderful was indeed happening on this day!
Inside the old high school which serves as the neighborhood's voting spot — at the end of that long snaking line – the two young Black women (in their late teens I guessed) stood outside the curtained voting booth, excited, nervous and obviously proud about what they were about to do.  The first, beaming and confidant, looked around, as if to savor her virgin voting experience, and then entered the booth and pulled the curtain closed.  She reappeared moments later, greeted by spontaneous applause and shouts of congratulations from voters and poll workers nearby.
Her anxious energy too much to control, the second young sister spun and paced as she waited her turn.  Uncertain about how exactly to cast her vote once behind the curtain, she was relieved to receive how-to instructions from a middle-aged white woman also waiting her turn to vote.  With a hug of support from her girlfriend, she jumped into the booth.  She too was greeted by applause when she exited, after having joined the more than 13 million first time voters who helped make this day historic in so many ways.
And for the second time that morning — on the day Barack Hussein Obama II was elected the forty-fourth President of the United States — my heart swelled and tears filled my eyes.

I believe in the idea of hope, but is it enough to just have an idea of hope?  Shouldn't we have real hope?
I believe in the prospects of hope, but how can I trust those prospects?  Who will assure me that these prospects will be realized?
I believe that there is hope for my adopted home, the United States, and for my place of birth, Afghanistan.  I believe that if we become smarter in dealing with the Afghans, get rid of corruption of our own officials as well as the corruption of the Afghan officials, we can have reason for hope for the people of Afghanistan and for our own people by extension.
I believe that there is hope that we will rid ourselves and Afghanistan of Al Qaida, when we recognize that Al Qaida is foreign to Afghanistan while Taliban are mostly home grown resistance fighters that fight against what they perceive to be foreign invaders. If they work together with Al Qaida, it is because they believe that their enemy's enemy is their friend.
I believe that there is hope that we will bring peace to Afghanistan and ultimately with it peace to ourselves, when we learn and internalize the Pashto saying that ""you can persuade an Afghan to go with you to hell, but you cannot force him to go with you to heaven"". 
I believe that there is hope for our long term peace, if we recognize that killing villagers in wedding parties and destroying their lives, their families and livelihood in other bombings should never be waived as collateral damage responded to by: ""we regret …"" If we recognize that these tragedies destroy lives of human beings and are not just scenes in some virtual video game or war movie. We cannot expect them to forget our atrocities, when we just apologize and blame others for our deeds.
I believe that our future is dependent on the hope that will move us towards making ourselves and our country a better and more responsible nation, not just for our own benefit but for the benefit of everyone that we aspire to support. 
I believe that our future can be more peaceful on the hope that our leaders will one day become more responsible and sensitized to the pain of other people.
I believe that Obama's election is a reason to have hope that this new responsible leaders have taken the reigns of our country. Let's hope that this hope is not in vain.

054199.txt,Blakelin,,18 - 30,"Anthem, Arizona","November 20, 2008",2008,Music Is the Air I Breathe,creativity,"I believe music has been the ""air"" in my life. George Elliot once said ""I think I should have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of music,"" and I couldn't agree more. As far back as I can remember I have loved music. Being in the car with my parents and hearing the music, reciting the words, and telling them who the artist was, is one my fondest memories. 
I first got involved with music in elementary school.  I remember going to music class, which was always a part of the school system where I'm from, and when the teacher would send us outside to play with the autoharp, I always wanted to be the one to go and play with it. It just fascinated me. When I was nine I started with the piano after hearing the technicality of Elton John's piano playing. I thought to myself ""I have to be able to do that."" I stuck with it for five years until I lost interest. Taking lessons felt like a job, not a hobby, and that made me want to give up. I went maybe two years without playing anything until I realized I had to play guitar. I bought one after my trip to Europe in 2005 and I have been addicted since.
Nine years, one piano, nine guitars, five amplifiers, one bouzouki, and two ukuleles later, I could not imagine going one day without touching an instrument. They provide an outlet for everything. No matter what kind of mood I am in, there is a song, or a key, or a chord progression that fits that mood. For every mood, for every feeling, and for every emotion, there is at least one song that fits. It can be 100 degrees outside, but one phrase of lyrics, one arpeggio, or even one simple note can send shivers throughout my body and give me goose bumps. For people who play, they know what I mean.
Music allows everything in the world to go away. Sitting down with an instrument puts you into your own little world, where the real world doesn't exist. It's like going on a short vacation. When I had some problems at home with my dad, I wrote songs to get my emotions out and I played other people's songs to get my mind clear. That was also when I started playing frequently with other people. 
	It doesn't matter how I feel, what kind of mood I'm in, or how my day is going. For me, it is like food: a basic necessity of life.  Music is the ""air"" that I breathe, and without I would be lost completely.

	I believe that friendship is very important in ones life. It helps us to understand things and to have great and not so great life experiences. I do not know what I would do without my friends. In my opinion help you be who you are. We all need friends.
	Friends are the ones who know all about you, in some aspects then your parents . They are the ones you laugh with at lunch, in class, after school and just any time you feel like it. One of my favorite things about friends is that you can have as many friends as you want and never ever get into trouble with anyone. You can also be yourself with your friends and if you have to act different then they are not your real friends.
	One of my many books is called Camy Baker's Love You Like A Sister. In this book Camy explains why friends are so important and tells you her 30 rules to being, and having great friends. One of the rules is to listen and to just be there for you friends. One more thing about friends, they love you no matter what, even if you make huge mistakes. Sure you fight some times, but every body does. Your friends are always going to have things that bug and that make you want to scream but that is friendship right.
 	Friends fade, your elementary best friend might not be your best friend in high school. I had this happen to me, it happens to everyone. We all have our social groups. I do not mean like the cheerleaders and jocks but the people you hang out with and talk to all of the time. The friends you run up you parents phone bill talking to. You can be friends with anyone if you give them a chance. Even if you friends have a problem with one of your other friends then that is fine. Just be open and understanding. Don't close yourself off from a great friend just because of the way they look and act. Get to know the person underneath that is who you are going to be friends with any way. 
	My friends might not always be my best friends but they will always be my friends. I will always just give them a hug and a warm smile when they are down and let them know I am there for them. We have our inside jokes and our  ""war"" stories but but at the end of the day we are just teens that like to hang out together. Friendship is how you get experiences that just boost who you are and your friendship. So get out there an and make a new friend even if it is scary you might really enjoy being around them. This I believe.

	I believe that you can't let others make you who you are.  There are people in this world who want nothing more than to see people fail, struggle, and never succeed. People will see that you are doing better than they are, have more than they have, even look better than they look, and they will talk about you, put you down, and spread lies about you. I believe that they do this to make themselves feel better about who they are and what they are not. People can bring you down so bad that you lower yourself to their level and do the same to them and others before they do it to you. Now, before you know it, you've turned into someone just like them. You shouldn't let this happen. It may be difficult at times to ignore them and continue living your life just as smooth, but by smiling and letting them see that they can't bring you down will make them look at themselves. People need to stop worrying about what the other person is doing and trying to bring them down and concentrate on how they can make their own lives better. Who is one to judge another? No one walking this earth today is perfect, by far. At the same time, you can't let what others think about you make you change who you are or the way you live or do things. You only have one life and you should live it to the fullest! People would judge you if you were completely perfect and if you succeed in life and you're happy with yourself, than nothing that they say about you will matter.

I put my pen down and took a sip of lukewarm water while I awaited the next patient. As I sat at a small table in the stale heat of a tiny, one roomed Haitian church, people of all ages crowded the doorway of the make-shift health clinic and formed somewhat of a line out the door and down the bumpy, dusty, dirt road. Overwhelmed with an odd mixture of joy, compassion and sorrow, I smiled welcomingly as the next patient sat down and smiled back at me. But unlike most of the patients before, this woman's smile had fear hiding in the corners of her lips. I prepared to take her blood pressure and as I slipped the cuff over her hand, she pulled away slowly. She looked down as she lifted a tiny bundle from her lap and pulled aside the blanket to reveal the most heart wrenching thing I had ever seen. I looked down at the dying baby, and bit my tongue to keep from crying. She was beautiful, yet so fragile, crippled with malnourishment. Living in America, this was something I had never seen before. Her arms were too small and fragile for me to take her blood pressure, so I sent her to the next table for a diagnosis and prescription from one of the doctors on our mission team.  
     Moments later I was called to the back of the church where a group from my team surrounded the mother and baby to pray. As I lay my hand on her thin arm, she turned her head slightly towards me, her eyes still closed, and her body still limp as Death gripped and suffocated her delicate frame. 
     The next morning, the mother arrived at the mission house as instructed by the doctors. In her arms, she held the beautiful, fragile child. The doctors examined her yet again to find ways to infuse nourishment into her motionless body. This time her eyes were slightly open, but she still barely moved. One of the nurses from our team slipped away quietly and returned moments later with an I.V. in her hand. The doctors were able to inject nutrients into the baby's bloodstream to help her grow stronger. Once again, we laid hands on the baby to pray for  her strength and healing. The doctors left the I.V. in and directed the mother how to care for the baby during the next few of days. 
    Several days later, the mother returned with her beautiful little girl. I hardly recognized her as the doctors removed the I.V. from her arm. She whimpered and squirmed, waving her hands about. That little whimper was the most beautiful sound I had ever heard.   
     I believe that miracles truly do happen. For me, as a Christian, I believe that miracles happen through prayer, through faith, and through the beauty and the power of God's love.

I believe in smiling because I think that is a great way to show happiness, friendship, and love towards everyone. I always have people asking me why do I smile so much?  I answer with a simple answer saying, ""I just love to smile"" for no particular reason because I think it is cool to always have a smile on my face!  I always have a smile around girls and they get all shy.  My family and friends know me by ""Happy J"".  I remember my high school football coach was the first person to name me that.  One day when I was walking home from school on a bright and sunny day I came across a nearby homeless guy.  When I was walking I noticed this guy all bummed out, sad, and lonely.  I right away approached him with a smile and greeted him, and with one simple smile I made his day.  I stayed like half an hour just talking to this guy and the homeless man began to tell me stories about childhood.   I remember this man telling me terrible stories about his father. His father would not care for him and leave him abandoned which is how he is until this day. I told him that I would always be there for him if he needs help or just a friend who he can talk to about personal things.  When I told him this I filled his heart with joy and comfort.  Even to this day I still see him and talk to him once in awhile just to see how he is doing.  Every time I see him he has a huge smile just like me.  I have really realized that by smiling it helps someone out a lot especially if it is from a friend. It reminds me that I am not alone in this world that I have someone who really cares for me with all their heart and shows their love. I realized that one person's smile can really make a difference in someone else's day.  I believe in smiling because when someone smiles at me it shows me that I am not alone in this world and there is someone who really cares for me with all their heart. That's why a simple smile can bring happiness, love, and joy to another person's day. I try to always have a huge smile every where I go, but hoping that my smile may be the reason for another person to smile too.  As a result I expect everyone to smile to someone other than family members and friends so that the person you smile at can realize that they are not alone in this world.

And how many times have you fathomed your small amount of time on this blue and green orb in the sky and realized you are not infinite? I have decided to use my time wisely, the life I live must be seen with the clarity of translucent eyes and felt by every sense I am equipped with, every moment too precious to watch spark and die. This is why I believe in savoring the moment. 
	In short, life is simply too beautiful to overlook. I remember looking up and seeing the complexity of the mangled branches that soar into the sky and stand silhouetted against the lavender and turquoise backdrop of a sinking sun; something almost too breathtaking to go unnoticed, yet regarded by many as just another aspect of a dying day. I have realized that if I let the intricate details of life dissipate then I have not taken full advantage and appreciated life to its fullest potential. Too easily I have discovered that vivid instances will diminish and fade into whitewashed memories, so now I savor the very essence of their happening. With the constantly ticking clocks and the glory of the world glowing all around me, I memorize every vapor in the air after rain, every laugh and every smile to cross my lips. By holding on to the moments that mean the most to me, I can attach their very significance to my memory and preserve the happiness it bestowed upon my life. 
	The days go by too fast. Memories must be captured like photographs in our minds and kept vivid and new, otherwise we lose the feelings they gave us. If I am too absent minded to grasp the beauty of the simplicity in the paint splatters of clouds across an electric blue sky, then what am I living for exactly? I still remember the feel of the chocolate brown coat of my first dog, back when I was three or four, soft and velveteen to the touch. Love and beauty and wonder all melted together, condensed into single flashes of memory. I must never disregard the ""small things"". After all, who is to say the intricate details are minor aspects? Maybe I live to seek the beauty of life and the feelings it provokes, now as well as in the future. If we do not step back and breathe in the violet sunset, or taste the crystallized snowflakes, or listen to the laughter of a small joyous brother, then we are allowing these small yet significant moments to wither away.

The world was changing and will forever be. I did not know at my young age that Iran, a theocratic republic, existed. Now, I see what is being done to the women of this country is inhumane and belittling. I believe in the freedom of Iranian women.
I know that women like me are not living fulfilling lives. They sit alone in a house full of children that belong to her and her husband's other wives. He is allowed to have four wives while she may marry one man. Her husband can have unlimited temporary marriages to prostitutes. She must remain faithful to him for the rest of her life. Laws prevent her from marrying more men just as they have allowed her husband to marry three other women. According to the US Department of State, a women may not at any time marry without consent; she therefore must get the ""consent of her father or grandfather to wed or the court's permission even if she is older than 18."" Men on the other hand may marry any one they choose after age 15 without consent of any elder of the family. 
Traditional Iranian families still practice arranged marriages, again limiting the freedom of its women to marry whom they choose and when they choose. Marriage is a contract between a man and a woman, the government and Allah. Women have very few freedoms in this area of their own lives. As lonely and unhappy that she may be with her husband, it is hard to divorce for sake of mere unhappiness. A woman may divorce if her husband is a drug addict, if he cannot provide for his family, he is mentally insane, or if he is impotent (US Department of State). The Iranian courts only will allow a divorce other wise if it has already been written out in the marriage contract. If a couple divorces and the mother remarries, children over the age of seven will be in full custody of their father rather than the mother. If they are under that age, they will remain with their mothers until they come of age. But things can be done. Laws need to be changed so that women may divorce as freely and men. Women have the right to live and love just one man and to be loved by just him. Men should not be allowed to freely control women's married life.
Iran is stuck in the past. The world ignores matters that deal with women's equality. I write this because very few American citizens know anything about Iran let alone its stance on women's rights. I write for people to know. I write so that one day these women will be free.

055262.txt,Barbara,,50 - 65,"Dallas, Texas","December 5, 2008",2008,Grandmother's Love,children;family,"I always knew that my grandmother adored us, but I never really understood until I had grandchildren of my own.
When my daughter had her first baby, I stood at the nursery window in awe.  The other relatives came and went but I stood watching until it was time for my Lily Grace to go to my daughter's room.  Even then I ran around the corner so that she wouldn't be out of my sight for more than a second.  I didn't give up my vigil until she was safe in my daughter's arms.  A few weeks later I called my brother and told him that I just found out how much our grandmother loved us – it was even more that we could have imagined.  Now that I have 3 grandchildren, my capacity to love has grown even more.  I love my daughter unconditionally, but a parent's love sometimes gets overpowered by the sleep deprivation, responsibility, and worries.  A grandmother is freed from those burdens and can just love.
This is not to say that my grandmotherly love is reserved only for my daughter's children.  My first grandchildren were actually the grandchildren of my dearest friend.  At three, Arianna knew that all she had to do was bring me a book and I would drop everything to read it to her.  Joey knew that if we got too wild and silly, I would take the blame.  My ex-husband has children with his second wife and when they visit I am in full grandma mode – he may fuss at them but I don't have to.  I play games with the child in the shopping cart in line ahead of me and make silly faces at crying children to make them laugh.
I believe I must love all children with the overwhelming love that a grandmother feels.  I believe that all children need to feel that kind of love from someone.
That overwhelming love I feel for my grandchildren has enabled me to love my friends and family more freely.  It is a selfless love that doesn't expect anything in return – not even good behavior.  It is liberating to say, ""I love you"" or to show affection without the need or expectation of hearing ""I love you, too"" in return, without thinking about disagreements or worrying about the future.  This is what I learned from being a grandmother.
As two of our great philosophers, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, said, ""All you need is love.""

055312.txt,Katie,,18 - 30,"Lufkin, Texas","December 6, 2008",2008,The Color of My Skin,change;race,"I have never been concerned with the pigmentation of my skin. I have never had to be.
I distinctly remember being in a social work class my freshman year and comprehending, for the first time, that racism was still prevalent. Race was simply a concept I read about in history textbooks and heard about on Martin Luther King Jr. day.
In light of our recent Presidential election, I am appalled. Ignorance is rearing its ugly head everywhere. Reports of assassination plans based solely on skin color, nooses in trees, and graffiti claiming that ""blacks"" are evil sound almost surreal, as if they are from the news reports of fifty years ago. Sadly, these instances are from today's world.
Yes, I realize we have come a long way. However, we cannot remain stagnant and satisfied. Do not simply stick your head in the sand as I did and pretend that hatred is not still pervasive.
Few consider the fact that there is no proof that racial differences exist, biologically speaking. Genetic studies have repeatedly attempted to discover genetic indications that inherent distinctions between races are biological, but there is no such evidence.
Unfortunately, although our conception of race does not biologically ""exist"", it still is apparent and real. It is real because we have made it real. To point to this research and say that race is not a valid entity that affects others is to negate the experiences of those who have suffered at the hands of racism everywhere. Still, it is disconcerting that we construct labels based on appearance as indications of innate flaws and characteristics.
People often say, ""I see no color"". I applaud the effort to be accepting, but this statement also denies the heartbreaking experiences that others have worked so hard to surmount. When we ""refuse to see color"", we refuse to give credence to circumstances that have shaped and haunted so many lives.
One principle of the social work code of ethics is the ""dignity and worth of a person"". A person deprived of validation of who they are because of the shade of skin they were born with is not a person shown that they are worthy and dignified just as they are.
Let me be the first to confess that I am guilty of generalizing a group of people because of physical attributes. However, I hope that, as a social worker and an American, I can help others overcome a solipsistic mindset and move towards a philosophy of love, understanding, and acceptance. 
I believe that change will take time and that we have to take it day by day. Change is a frightening, deliberate process that comes gradually, but it is a necessity nevertheless. My hope is that we can defeat hatred and show the world that we believe in the dignity and worth of each person.
With your help, visions of change can become a reality.
Change is needed. Change is coming. Change can start with you and me.
This I believe.

""Tammie, you look very pretty in that dress, but maybe you shouldn't pick up your second cookie,"" aunts would say to me. I heard little comments like this daily and I would continue what I was doing, which was eating my second cookie. As I got older, I came to the realization that not giving the comments the time of day ticked my aunts off! That's why I came to the decision early in my life that I would be myself no matter the circumstance. ""Be yourself."" I personally live by these words. Everyone is entitled to live their life the way they want to.  When someone threatens my belief, I make sure they are put in their place.
In my teens, I had an eye opening experience. I was at a sleepover and while my best friend and I were in her room gossiping, I got thirsty. I was getting my soda from the kitchen when her aunt walked in; she had shoulders like a man and was a little overweight. She was there visiting for the day. As I reached into the refrigerator for my soda and she opened her mouth, which was full of food, to say ""you definitely don't need that, in fact I should put your fat butt on a diet.""  I was brought up to always have respect for my elders and no matter the situation never talk back to them. I was angry at the fact that I was just insulted by a woman who hardly knew me. As the words rolled off her tongue, tears rolled down my face and I ran to tell my friend what happened.
I couldn't take my mind off how a stranger's words could pierce through my ""tough skin"". I couldn't believe that this woman had the audacity to try to dictate what I did with MY LIFE. I began to think of a way to show this stranger that I, Tammie Olagbaju, am the boss of my life. So, with a smirk on my face, I grabbed the can of soda and walked into the living room. She was on the couch, looking all high and mighty, and I had the perfect plan. I planted my ""fat butt"" right beside her and opened my soda while humming a happy tune. When I was done I let out a tiny burp and said ""excuse me"" with a high pitched voice. Right before I turned the corner, with that same smirk on my face, I turned around and our eyes met. Mine said ""say something else, I dare you!"" and all I got back was blank stare.
This was my silent protest. I made it known that I am who I am and nobody should ever try to change that. I made sure that I was still respectful, while asserting the fact that I am not one to be messed with.

That principle is truth; this is something that I really believe. It started when I was in fourth grade, a friend of mine came up from New York City for a visit. He is a Buddhist to the extreme. Were you have to be pure inside and out. So being truthful is being pure. He said that ""if you tell the truth, you won't go to hell."" Since I was a kid, I believed him. From then on I told the truth and nothing but the truth.
Telling the truth all the time isn't easy. Back then I was scared of the place called ""hell."" No body knew if it existed, but one thing is for sure when I die I don't want to go there. To this day I almost always tell truth. If I lie, I would dig myself a deeper hole or be living in a world of illusion. It just means I am not ready for the real world when I lie. However I am ready, by telling the truth. The truth is something that gets me moving through the day, if I would lie I would just be living a day behind.
This belief is a big part of my life. I try to tell all the truth sometimes I would want to lie to make the other person feel better but it ends up making both of us feel bad at end of the day. I started young and it has got me prepared for the future of truth telling.

055504.txt,Brendan,,18 - 30,"Denver, Colorado","December 8, 2008",2008,Reverence for Animals,nature;pets & animals;values & spirituality,"I believe in grizzly bears. Vegetarians have lots of different reasons for not eating meat – health, the environment, karma – but that's mine: grizzly bears.
In the past four years climbing, backpacking and hiking in the American West, I've seen all manner of wild creatures: Mountain goats, bighorn sheep, porcupines, gila monsters, marmots, elk, bald eagles, mountain lions, and my climbing partner after 11 hours of being roped to me. But I've only seen one grizzly. One summer morning, we were lucky enough to turn a corner on a trail in the Tetons and spot a cub milling around, looking for some breakfast.
As we stopped and backed away, the cub ambled down a boulderfield, paying us no attention. It poked its nose around in search of food, then looked up a tree trunk and in a second, lunged about four feet up the tree, sticking its claws in the bark and hanging on to get a better view.
I stood there in awe, madly clicking my camera trying to get a decent photo. In one moment, I was scared for my safety, excited that I had finally seen a grizzly, drawn toward it out of curiosity, and repelled by the knowledge that the bear could rip my face off with one swipe of its paw.
In the world we've built, with defenses against almost everything we think can harm us, it's refreshing that I can still get myself to a place where such a rare, magical animal lives. I spend so much time in the mountains, where I'm a guest of the animals who live there, that it only makes sense to me to respect the lives of all animals, even if they taste good. Because I'm sure I'd taste pretty good to a bear or a mountain lion.
Grizzly bear meat hasn't been on Americans' dinner menus for a couple hundred years, and most of us don't even have to hunt for our food anymore. We eat things called ""prosciutto"" and ""sirloin,"" not ""pig"" and ""cow.""
I grew up eating ""meat."" A few years ago, I made a decision to stop eating animals.
I can't make a distinction between my dog, who's convinced me she loves me, and another four-legged animal made of something we call ""pork."" I can't draw a line between a wild grizzly bear that stops me mid-stride and makes me fumble for my camera, and a chicken whose life we value in terms of how many McNuggets we can make out of its flesh.
I don't try to convince other people to become vegetarian. Instead, I usually mention that my dad's a butcher, that he's run a business selling meat for 35 years. People ask what my dad thinks of me being a vegetarian. I tell them he reacted the same way he did when I got a tattoo, or when I took a huge pay cut to work at a nonprofit: He just shrugged, and, as always, let me do what I thought was going to make me happy.
Sure, when it's time for Christmas dinner with the family, I always eat a bit light. But my last gift from my dad? An incredible portrait of a grizzly cub, taken in the Tetons. My grizzly, I like to think.

055616.txt,Gabe,,18 - 30,"Oxnard, California","December 9, 2008",2008,The Postive Effects of Negative Thinking,question,"People always used to ask me, ""What's wrong?""  I always used to say, ""Nothing.""  But that wasn't quite true.  It seems a lot of people go through life blabbering about how happy they are, how great life is, or how beautiful the world is.  And while I love a lot of things about myself, my life, and the world, I'm more aware of negative aspects of these things.  People often try to peg me as a pessimist, but I describe myself as a realist.  I'm real about what I don't like about things, and real about how I plan on changing what I don't like.  How will I change these things?  It begins with a simple belief:  I believe in the positive effects of negative thinking.
     I'm reminded of one story which was particularly important in the forming of my belief.  In 2006, shortly after returning to the U.S. from travelling abroad, I read about an Iraq War protest in Los Angeles.  I had a lot of negative thoughts about the war in Iraq.  I felt like it was another Vietnam.  I thought that we were destroying the country of a population who was largely innocent and non-participants in any kind of terrorist acts.  I was mad at our government and wanted to do something about it.  So, I drove out to L.A. early on a Saturday morning to attend the protest.  
     At the protest were all kinds of different people who had negative thoughts about the war in Iraq.  People from all walks of life were united in their opposition to the war:  straight and gay, old and young, men and women, punkers, skaters and corporate America desk jockeys.  From all this negative thinking came a very strong positive effect:  unity.  This was one of the few times that I felt united with many different people.  And it all happened because of my negative thoughts about the war.
     I continue to believe the positive effects and negative thinking and this belief colors actions in my everyday life.  I wonder if I'll still believe in the power of negative thinking once I get married and have children.  Perhaps that will make the optimist inside me blossom.  Until then, I'll continue believing that looking at the negative aspects of life can bring positive results.

055746.txt,Lalee,,18 - 30,"Northfield, Minnesota","December 9, 2008",2008,The Function of Colors,self-knowledge,"I believe in colors.
A year ago, I went to Lake Kariba with my class. We slept on sailboats and could see the sunrise and the sunset for the five days we were there. After having a wild water fight on our sailboats, my friend Hannah and I decided that we should watch the sunset. We stayed on our sailboat while rest of our class was on land making dinner. I was extremely hyped up and excited to see the sunset on Lake Kariba; however, as soon as the sun began to set, the energy in my body disappeared and suddenly I stared at the sunset peacefully. The beautiful mix of orange, yellow, blue, purple, and pink made us unwind, lighten up and think about the things in life that never occurred to us. They made us change the mood around us by making it too comfortable and too relaxed. 
I realized how colors can communicate emotions when I painted a valentine poster for my boyfriend, Sean. I did not know what to do, but I knew I wanted to create an abstract heart. I thought to myself, how am I going to paint an abstract heart? I was confused for a while until my good friend told me to use powerful colors to describe my love for Sean instead of painting a heart. I was confused because how can one describe love using colors? So, I applied spontaneous colors on the poster using my finger tips. I just followed my emotions that dashed through my mind while I was thinking Sean. Blue, red, yellow, green, purple, indigo and many other colors intertwined with each other. I was happy; happy because as I carefully analyzed the poster, my love for him was portrayed and I couldn't think of anything better that would come close to describe that emotion.
The next day, I took my love on the paper and gave it to Sean. He was speechless and amazed. I saw his blue crystal sparkling eyes looking at the poster as if he had never seen these colors in his life. He grabbed me and pressed me against his chest. I felt his warmth, he felt my warmth. Not only did the colors communicate my love for him, but also the love we have for each other. 
Colors can change my mood and communicate my emotions. This I believe.

Ever since I was a kid, I would always get sick; I would fall all the time, blood everywhere.  I never stopped to think why bad this things would happen to me; but finally figured out that everything happens for a reason.  That's what I believe.  	
	I was in middle school, every day when I got home from school, I wouldn't even go inside my house, I would go straight to get my bike and go ride it on the street.  Did I mention that my mom would prohibit me from doing that?  The reason I never really worried about it was because my mom used to work and she wouldn't get home till later in the evening.  I had a blast every day, I would look forward for school to end and ride my bike when I got home.  At first I would tell my friends that I couldn't go outside my house with my bike because my mom didn't like for me to be in the street. She was always afraid of me falling.  As a middle school student though, I listened to my friends just as any other kid my age would.  It happened so often that I fell from my bicycle.  I had cuts everywhere and I didn't want for my mom to see me, because I already knew I was going to get yelled at, and I was going to get hit.  Little by little I learned to listen to my mom because bad things happen when you don't.  
	That was only one of the many times I would not listen to my mom.  I knew something bad would happen when I didn't listen to her; but nothing big had happened to me, so it didn't worry me much.  One day I got home from school; farely early because I had a game that same evening and it was pretty long way to get to where I was going to play.  So I got home, and I was in a hurry since it wasn't my mom who was going to take me, it was my friends mom and I didn't want to be late.  Right when I came in the house my mom asked me if I had eaten something and I said ""no"", she told me to eat something because I hadnt eaten anything all day and I had a game later that day.  I was very much in hurry that I got mad right away and I yelled at my mom, and told her "" no mom! You  have to take me to my friend's house now, because I have a game at 5:30 and I don't want to be late!""  My mom got really mad and she yelled at me, but I don't really remember what she told me.  So I got to the game, started warming up.  I had forgotten about the whole fight that I had with my mom earlier.  I sure remembered me, yelling at her for no reason when I dislocated my right shoulder while playing.  I didn't even enjoy much of the game because it happened so fast; it happened between the first minute of the game.  I was in shock and scared because I didn't really know what had happened at first.  Worse yet, their was no trainer around the school so I was still wondering around the school with my coach searching for a trainer, or simply someone who knew how to pop my shoulder back in.  No luck, I had to be taken to the hospital where I figured it would be fast because I was taken to the Emergency Room.  No luck their either, it seemed like I waited longer in there.  
I reflected back to when I talked back to my mom; and she even remembered me when she got to the hospital.  I was disappointed in myself for doing that, and I apologized to my mom.  After that day it all happened, I haven't talked back to her at all.  I obey her at all times and things like the ones mentioned havent happened since.  Word of advice, respect everyone, especially your mom.

056098.txt,Tom,,18 - 30,"Mentor, Ohio","December 11, 2008",2008,Follow the Leader,responsibility,"Follow the Leader
	I believe that leadership is one of the most important qualities a person can have in our society today.
	Most of my life I have always strived to be a good leader and most of my life I have failed and remained being just another follower. There is a reason why I have always wanted to be a good leader and I don't think I completely realized how to become a good leader until I joined the high school swim team.
	When I was in high school I swam for our boys swim team, and every year the coach would choose a captain two or three weeks after the season started. I noticed it was very easy for the coach to pick the captain because it was obvious that the person had a lot of influence over the other kids during practice and at meets. Also he was someone that contributed a lot of his time to the team; he would rarely missed practice and would most likely be a senior who had swam all four years of his high school career. I decided that my goal was to become the captain of the swim team, so that I could gain leadership skills in life.
	So I began to work hard and I became good friends with the captains in grades above me. I realized that in order to be a good captain u have to be a great follower. When other swimmers saw me hanging out with the captain they began to build respect for me as well, and soon I realized that the coach was beginning to give me more and more responsibilities. This continued on throughout my swimming career and I began to think that my chances were extremely good that I would become the next captain.
	When my senior year began and the swim season started once more. It seemed that almost everyone already knew that I would be the captain before the coach had even decided. I was meeting with the coach almost everyday and he used me as a gateway to communicate with the other swimmers on the team. I also realized how important I had become and that I had more power over decisions that were made, for example I would meet with the coach before meets to give him my opinion on the line ups. This sense of leadership intrigued me to become a leadership in other areas besides swimming.
	Being the captain of the boys swim team was one of the greatest experiences of my life, and has greatly changed me in the best of ways. I learned that leadership can bring you much more respect and power in your lifetime, and even though there are more responsibilities the rewards greatly outweigh them. I believe that everyone has the potential to become a leader, but you cannot be lazy. You have to work hard and accept responsibility before you can reek the benefits.

Everyone these days are categorizing people by the way they look or based on the people they hang out with. Categories play a major part in how the schools are being divided. This could make kids feel uncomfortable or make them not want to attend school because of the way people look at them or act towards them. 
I've been called fat by some, then called skinny by others. I've been labeled as rude and stuck up because I'm white. People don't understand how much it hurts to be called things like that. I don't have a high self-esteem and I'm not comfortable with my appearance no matter how many times people call me skinny, pretty, and nice. I get compliments however I don't believe them because of the other things I've been called. I have become stronger due to the fact that I have had to build self-esteem and tell myself I am not fat or ugly. A saying that helps me relate to the way I'm feeling and helps me realize that nobody's perfect is,  ""It's not who you are that holds you back, but it's who you think you're not."" 
 Most people don't intentionally make fun of others; sometimes a small comment like ""what is she wearing?"" could start a lot of put downs about that person. Even though that person will most likely never know you said anything, how are you feeling about saying it? I know that if I knew someone was talking about me I would start to question my appearance and myself and that's not good for anyone. Some people could go into a stage of depression because of the criticisms and that's not healthy for anyone.  
I was once in a situation where I was at a football game and my friends and I mentioned that one of the cheerleaders weren't good enough to be cheering and her mother was sitting right behind us. I will never forget the look I received from her; that look changed me. I didn't really think anything of it at first until I saw the way she was acting after we mentioned something. It was a sad, mad, and disappointed look all at the same time. It hurt me to see her hurt and know I was the one that did that to her. I learned at that moment it's not right to judge people because everyone is just trying to get through life and life shouldn't be based on what people look like and who they hang out with but rather who they are underneath. Everyone is equal in a way and I think it's about time people realized that and treat everyone equally.

Subsequently, storing or cooking meat in these same containers often gave diners nasty ailments.  Some Semitic tribes must have divined this relationship because they wrote dietary, or, kashruth, laws (with gruesome examples) that forbade such combinations: ""Thou shall not seethe a calf in its mother's milk.""  Kashruth means, literally, ""fitness,"" in Hebrew.
Growing up, my family chose to keep semi-kosher.  This meant either milk meals or meat meals, among other things.  It also meant no pork— another notoriously diseased meat during ancient times.  However, in this day and age, the question arises: why does anyone still abide by such antiquated rules?  Hello!  We have Tupperware and refrigerators now.  
As an instructor of college writing, I speak to my students about the importance of making choices as they flesh out their ideas during the drafting process.  And when I return home from teaching with an eye to pursuing my own studies and writings I often find, instead, a phone bill, another bill I can't account for, missed communiqué with friends and family, or any number of pressing responsibilities.  I choose to attend to all these household tasks at the same time by way of cooking.  The privilege of cooking my own meals bestows on me a moment of reflection.  Cooking focuses my energies on my home and my relationships.  After all, I have a family to call and an apartment with bills to pay, in the first place.  Anybody who comes into my home gets fed.  Cooking allows me to know my body and integrate its needs into my life.  
I believe in the power of cooking what I eat.  I believe in choosing what I cook.  I believe in caramelizing onions, white wine reducing in a pan, garlic going sweet— cream of broccoli soup coming together.  I believe in whole wheat toast and tangerines— quinoa and cabbage.  
Cooking reminds me that one has sovereignty over a precious few aspects of one's life.  
As a result, deciding each and every day what I choose to put in my body fills me with gratitude, a feeling of safety, and blessing.  Indeed, I frequently find myself pausing over steaming pasta and red sauce— stopping to give thanks for the food that sustains me.  Less frequently do I catch myself praying over takeout.  
Over the years, my personal dietary guidelines have grown more free-form and variable— guided more by modern day health considerations than by kashruth proscriptions.  Nevertheless, these proscriptions taught me to make choices that fit me.  In my belief, the cook controls the health and happiness— the fitness— of the whole household.

I remember these times so fondly because the sad times were heartbreaking, so much so that I still feel the cracks in my heart ache. The good times were so amazing that I can't help but smile when these moments re-visit me. Then I start to think about the in between times, the moments that fill in the space between the extravagant ones. They are small when they happen, simple, and unexpected. These very same moments are the ones that make up the meaning of life and eventually fill in the cracks. I believe that the small memories are the ones that shape who we are as individuals and are the ones that we miss the most.
	I have always heard the saying, ""enjoy the simple things in life"" or ""take time to stop and smell the roses."" I didn't understand this until I graduated high school three years ago and moved out on my own. It was then that I realized how complicated, stressful, and difficult life can be. I realize now how much I struggled with setting such high, sometimes unattainable, unrealistic expectations for myself. I was always so concerned with reaching for my goals that I failed to enjoy the simple, beautiful moments in life. To me these simple moments vary widely, but are comparable in greatness. These are the moments where I failed to stop and enjoy the breath of my first puppy, the peaceful purr of a kitten, a hug from someone I love, the bloom of tulips in the spring, the way my house smells, or the joy in my mom's eyes when I come home to visit. All these simple moments are easy to look past and take for granted, and I believe that's what makes them so precious, so memorable.
	When I moved out of my house and into my very first apartment to start my very first semester of college, I failed to realize the magnitude of it all. I slowly went through the belongings in my room and tried to decipher what I need to bring with me to my new life. My mom was sifting though the house, picking up the last minute items that I might have forgotten to purchase. We packed my little two door car to the brim. We both, in our own way, were trying to avoid the inevitable goodbye that we knew was going to come too soon. I drove down to my dad's shop, where he spent most of his time, to say my final goodbye to my parents. My dad checked my car to make sure everything was packed securely and fastened in place. Then I turned around and when my eyes met with my moms I could not only see the pain in them but feel it in my heart. The tears welled up and within seconds my moms face had gone from a proud parent to a worried, lonely, and protective mother.  When I closed the door of my car, and essentially a chapter in my book of life, I heard my dad tell my mom to quit crying and I saw her walk back to the house alone.
	I never would have realized that this moment, this small moment, would have had such an impact on my life.  When I look back I see how hard it must have been for a mother who raised two children, protecting them from the wrath of alcoholism their father suffered with, see the oldest, closest to her pack up her precious belongings and move to a new city. When I replay this episode in my mind I see an extremely distraught woman in my head and I just want to jump back in time and stay. I want to go back and hug her and reassure her that I will always be her little girl. But I had to go, every child has to move on, but I'm left with the vision of my mother being told to stop caring so much and walk back up to our house alone. I can't image how long she must have cried. 
	My first year of college was bittersweet. It was a great learning experience, paying my own bills and learning how to balance school and work. It was a good school year for me but I was relieved to cure my homesickness when I moved back for the summer. I loved being back home and having home cooked meals and a queen size bed to sleep in. I worked a lot, for most of the summer I had two jobs and worked double shifts during the week. When I had some time off I would go for long runs or walks. I would run down the country roads, with the sun beating down on me, and release all the anger I had inside. It was my stress reliever, my escape. Most of the time my mom and I would go together and sometimes even my brother would join us. We would run until we couldn't run anymore and our fast paces out slow until were walking side by side, enjoying each other's company.  
	These small moments and many others that I spent with the closest people in my life, at the time, my mom and brother, mean so much to me. It was these small moments that I can still remember so vividly that I feel like I could just jump back into them. I also realize now how much my mom cared for my brother and me. She wanted us to learn to be good people and be health people on the inside and out. As I live and learn I realize that life is not a movie, there is no fast forwarding though the sad times and no rewinding the great ones. It goes by so fast and it's important to me and I believe that we need to cherish the little moments that put the smiles on our faces or give us a feeling of love and belonging, even if it's as simple of the smell of your home.

057043.txt,John,,18 - 30,"Crouse, North Carolina","December 30, 2008",2008,Everyone Gives Birth,empathy & compassion;values & spirituality,"I believe that men and women give birth.  That child, adult, old an young, gay and straight, black and white, are all capable of the miraculous process of birth.  To give birth is not only a process of biology but also a behavior of spirit.  I believe the soul births the macrocosm in which peace and agony exist.  Birth transcends all barriers be they language, race, or creed.  I believe the process of birth is a painful one, but one which we must all endure.
Souls are not a dime a dozen –not a figment of imagination, not a concept of mysticism, or a method of transportation to heaven.  Souls are the reality of all our thoughts, beliefs, loves, and pains.  Souls talk. Souls react to one another.  When passing someone on the sidewalk and I get that tingle in the pit of my stomach, and hear that voice speaking in my head commanding, ""Smile at them. Say good morning.""  That's the conversation between souls. That's my soul birthing a moment of felicity for the world. 
Recently I was driving home from work.  Tired and depressed about my job, my life, my finances I noticed a man sitting under a bridge.  He was dirty, unshaven, wore ragged pants, and on his head was a trucker's cap so faded I couldn't tell if it was tan or badly faded black.  He sat Indian style.  ""Great!"" I said under my breath as the traffic light turned red, ""This guy is going to come up to the car and beg for money.""  ""Go get a Job!"" was going to be my response from the car window, which I certainly wasn't going to roll down.  The light seemed to stay on red endlessly, but ""Bridge Man"", as I've come to call him, sat under the overpass silent and looking me dead in the eyes.  My soul began the contractions of birth.  I didn't know what I was about to bring forth into the world, but it confounded me as to why I would be reacting in this manner towards this stranger.  Suddenly, I delivered a corpus of compassion, oozing and slimy with feelings.
At last the light turned green and I floored the gas pedal, speeding away from him leaving my newly born ball of compassion behind like an abandoned child on a stranger's doorstep.  I felt awful, repugnant, and dirty.  I didn't listen to my soul.  I didn't receive Bridge Man's gift of spiritual richness, despite physical poverty.  I was to self-involved to realize that in that moment we are all connected through our souls.  
Bridge Man reminds me that our souls give spiritual gifts to the world through us, and that we as humans are charged with the mission of sharing these gifts.  I believe that the soul gives birth, and just as a newly birthed baby opens its eyes to a brand new world.  Our spiritual births allow us to open our eyes to a new world. A world of peace.

Why does that make us unprofessional is it because we have displayed our art on our body instead on our living room wall? In some cultures having a tattoo is a symbol of marriage, age, and religious belief, but yet in our society if I have a tattoo of a cross, a symbol of my religion showing some become offended. In the line of work I am going into its unprofessional to have a tattoo showing. I don't believe if I report to someone's house to help them, possibly saving their life they will become offended by the artwork on my arms. I believe that that if a person is willing to put artwork on their skin to symbolize many different things, they shouldn't be deemed unprofessional because they are so proud to show it on their time in the workplace or in public. When my own mother who is a physical therapists assistant is pretty much deemed unprofessional and told to cover up her artwork because it was visible and has to buy a special watch to cover up her roses around her wrist, and put a band-aid over the dolphins on her calf. I think that's just went over the edge with being unprofessional and being singled out due to the fact that she has artwork showing I believe that everyone show just look at the artwork on people not due to the that they have artwork it should be because the artwork is and will always be interesting. If people could get past the fact the o my gosh they have a tattoo and look at it in the perspective that they love their beliefs so much or they love their child so much to have it permantly on their skin I don't think I would have this topic to type on.

058185.txt,Lauri,,Under 18,"Pittsburg, Kansas","January 20, 2009",2009,The Lighting of A Storm,nature,"I believe in storms. I believe that everyone is going to face a storm. I believe that even when you think that you can run from them you can't. I believe that storms serve a purpose of being, not just to make you struggle or cry, but to help recognize that which is important.
In 2006 when my family and I had decided to move to Houston Texas we were faced with a difficult storm that could have destroyed our lives. While during the storm we thought of all the possible ways to beat the storm or should I say run from it. We wanted to sleep it away at a hotel but all hotels were closed and had no more rooms available. Even wanted to take refuge at a gas station but the power went out. So we had nothing left to do but to keep driving. Now it's pitch black at 2 a.m. thundering and lighting, the streets were flooded while only able to drive 25 mph, and we were in the middle of nowhere. By ourselves no one in sight just a lonely van with a family of four inside with the next city three hrs away.
Although it may have seemed like we never going to get through or overcome it, in return it brought us together. The storm helped us set aside our difference's, made realize just how important we are to each other. So like other people who don't like the rain, thunder, and lighting I happen to love it. Sometimes when it leases expected something comes along to guide and nurture us back to health. In my case this storm taught and reminded me that it may get rough, shower, thunder, even lighting in our lives. But through it all we can still keep moving even when we think we can't. 
Most of the times storms don't make any sense but it's after we have overcome or gone completely through the storm that we realize the purpose. Sure I believe in life, and sometimes I believe in luck, and there's no doubt that I believe in God. But I also believe in storms, I believe that storms are meant for everyone. I believe that storms come just in the nick of time. This I believe.

058235.txt,Summer,,Under 18,"Lookout Mountain, Tennessee","January 21, 2009",2009,Living in the Present,self-knowledge,"I believe that the universe is kind. I believe that everything that occurs in my life is happening for me. I believe that every human being should attempt to live in the present, day by day. Every time that I have struggled through a challenging or upsetting situation, I have found that the lessons learned outweigh the negative experience. 
Last year, I was given the blessing of meeting and connecting with a twenty- eight year old football star by the name of Victor Ellis. Victor played for the University of Alabama. He was a phenomenal player and student, but sadly he suffered from a rare form of cancer. A doctor notified Victor that he had six months to live. In the end, he almost doubled his estimated time, and the ten months that I knew him affected my life greatly. His belief that everything happens for a reason inspired me. It all clicked. At first, I had sensed that the universe was cruel for ending such an amazing guy's life at such a young age. Soon after, I came to consider that maybe Victor's death was meant to be like this and that in reality, it was his time to go. With his last month approaching, he had accepted his cancer, and even at the near end of his twenty- eight year journey, he lived his life to the fullest. 
	The influence that Victor's life played on so many people could not have been a coincidence. It was all planned. Victor's positive outlook on his life gave me a new perspective on mine. I now have become more hopeful and optimistic because I know that the universe is helping me, always. I trust that it is guiding my life in the right direction. I recognize that everything unfolds differently for each human being, and that each path is perfect for the person who receives it. These beliefs have helped me to venture out to see the good that comes from a hard situation. I try to apply this to my life everyday by being grateful for everything I have, instead of being bitter about certain things that do not go my way. I now understand that if it was not Victor's time to leave this earth, then he would still be on it today. I have also realized that the universe will only give me what I can handle. I belief it is working for me and I trust it to operate my life.

The ascent was like walking straight up it was so steep that they put a rail and rope to literally pull yourself a little further up. I was six years old so the climb up Mt Fuji would seem to difficult for such a little person, and that was exactly what my parents thought, they had already planned to take me down after half way but when I had walked one hundred steps then slept for two minuets all the way up the steep and jagged rocks I was not going to just go back down. When  I decided to continue on my parents  were not thrilled because they thought that the further I got up the further it would be for them to take me down, but I love proving people wrong about me. Many hours later I took the last one hundredth step I would need to summit Mt Fuji the excitement and exhaustion came all at once and I just wanted to drop right there, I had done it and if I had to I could do it again, well maybe… Being as little as I was I was curious to see what I had just spent the entire day climbing to see, so I walked over to the edge of the opening in the volcano to look down it was interesting but really I had just pulled myself up a mountain to see a hole to say the least it was a disappointment so I was moping   a little and then one of the Buddhist monks came over he look like you would expect a monk to look like he was wearing the traditional kimono and had a shaved head so when you see him he calls respect but  to me he looked like a big teddy bear. So he came over to where my dad and I were standing and asked me my age and I told him in the little Japanese that I could that I was six and with shock on his face he turns to my dad and said ""you carried her up all this way"" laughing my dad replied ""no I could hardly pull myself up here let alone her"" the monk look excited and a little surprised he preceded to talk to my dad in Japanese so I had no clue what was going on after they had finished talking my dad told me that I was the youngest person the monks had found that had climbed to the top.  Because of my stubbornness I was able to do something no one else my age had done plus they gave me a great present.  I have had to ""climb mountains"" in my life that seem to be the Everest of all problems,  but knowing that I had climbed a reached the top helps me to continue  on even when I was the one who believes I can't complete my goal or overcome whatever problem I was going through. That is why I believe in continuing on when people believe you can't possibly make it.

""I believe happiness brings out the best in all of us."" I think that is true. When you are happy you are smiling and joking around and just very loving people want to be around you. Even though some people hide there unhappiness behind a smile you are still full of happiness. If you are grumpy and not smiling or not joking around mostly people are not going to want to be around you not in a bad way, but in way that they do not want to be blamed for something and or have something get taken out on, on them. 
""I believe each day should begin and end with happiness."" I do not really have much to say about this because it pretty much explains itself. But what a great day would that be to begin and end the day with happiness. You might not know, but you could brighten someone else day being happy. 
""I believe each one of us create a happiness of our own."" Each one of us has a reason why we are happy. You are not just happy just because there has to be a reason. The reason could simple be because you love life. We either create at that reason or someone does something for us to create at that reason.
When I was little child my mom would always say I was never and fussy baby. I was always happy. I had happiness when I woke up and when I laid my little head down to sleep. Even though I was young and did not really understand what happiness was others did and always knew I was.  
There was a time when I was very sick; I was about 1 or 2. My mom never knew I was sick I never cried I never winded I was just not my self one day. So she took me to the doctor, Dr. Harper and finally found out I had strep throat, an ear infection in both my ears, 104 fever. I was a very sick baby. Dr. Harper asked my mom why she did not bring me in sooner because this could have become very serious for how young I was. My mom told him I never acted sick I was still the same as I ever was I was still full of happiness just  a little unhappy and I hung on my mom a little more than I normally did, I was not eating or drinking like normal so she thought that maybe I was not feeling well so she took my to the doctor and found out I was sick.
And till this day I will still not tell my mom if I am not feeling well. I am not a big complainer. I am just always full of happiness.

""Change we can believe in."" That statement is now famous worldwide. But I beg of just one question. How much change can one man bring? Not putting down on Barack Obama, but how much change can a person from a small town in Idaho make? The answer is almost nothing; the person is usually average, no athletic prowess, no genius, no hair-brained scheme to make money. I am one of three hundred million people in the USA with no real talent or original ideas.
	WE have all seen the Autism Speaks commercial. It states a simple fact; you as a person have more chance of being Autistic then a Broadway star, or an MVP baseball player. I seem to get the idea that I will both fail and develop Autism in my average lifetime. I am not trying to naysay or depress anybody but I see that as an average American, I should spend my time focused on what is ""going good"" today and not how I am going to write the next great novel r make a million dollars. 
	This I believe, try to be the best you can be but don't think that money and wealth can trump things like values or love of something greater then yourself. Simply put American values are a bygone standard. I am not talking about things like gay marriage or gun control, but of the general line that American life follows. The general goal is a steep upward slant towards wealth. The problem is not just the pursuit of wealth but the mix-up that it can bring happiness. Sure, you can make a lot of money but if you fail to see the true meaning of life you will fall into unhappiness.

059661.txt,Miayona,,18 - 30,"Jax, Fl 32211, Florida","February 12, 2009",2009,This I Believe,love,"I believe in the power of Love. It is said that Love is a powerful four letter word, but so is Hate. I have learned a lot from these two words, both from movies such as the hit Gran Torino and life experiences such as going to a mixed raced school or coming home to a mixed raced neighborhood. I believe Love can conquer all, even the world of Hate. I also believe we the people have a choice to decipher which of these two words we will stand on.
	Everyday I experience Love. When I go home to loving family, I am greeted with a hello or a hug. My mother always taught me to love others no matter who they are, where they came from, or the color of their skin. In middle school, where it was mostly blacks, I befriended a girl of the Caucasian race. We were best friends. We did everything together, whether it was sharing our lunch, walking home together from school, or just sitting together on the bus. We were inseparable. Many people did not understand the concept of black and white. We would get stares and they would wonder why I didn't hang with the all black group and she wouldn't hang with the all white group. But the love and respect we had for each other would not allow us to see color.
	Recently, I saw a movie that dealt with Love and Hate. The movie Gran Torino, tells the story of a man (Clint Eastwood), who despised the Asian race because of his past experiences in the Vietnam War. Throughout the movie, he paints a picture of all Asians as being poor, thuggish, and unethical. He then meets two Asian siblings, whom he over a period of time begins to fall in love with. Eventually, he learns to put his pride aside and becomes more open to those who were different from him. He shared food, laughter, encouraging words and even Love. He began to see that true characteristics are not defined by a group of people, but by the individual himself.
	We should learn to love one another more and more, day by day, including our worst enemies. We should be able to have true affection for each other; after all, that is the true meaning of Love. And no matter the circumstances, we should uphold this word called Love, and learn, love and live it to the fullest.
	Living in this world, we should not let one negative experience with an individual define the fate or the outcome of a race of people. We have to be able to love and see one another as equal. Before you know it, we all will get the chance to share and instill these two words: Love and Hate into the next generation, but it is up to you as an individual to share the right one.

059871.txt,Carol,,50 - 65,"Atlanta,, Georgia","February 16, 2009",2009,Strok: A Tale of Affirmation,illness;self-determination,"Stroke: A Tale of Affirmation
It began with the headaches that initially felt like the flutter of butterfly wings on the left side of my temple, gradually escalating to what I suspect it must feel like to have that little penguin from the movie, Happy Feet tap dancing in my head. Self-diagnosing, I attributed them to problems with my sinuses, or to the barometric pressure due to the highs and lows of Atlanta's fickle winter temperatures. 
A rushing sound, much like running water followed, resulting in a frantic search throughout my house to see if faucets were running somewhere. Lying in bed later that night the mystery was solved. The sound was coming from my head or rather my left ear. I self-medicated for a couple days by taking Tylenol. I also threw in a few M&Ms – well for good measure. When nothing worked, I made an appointment with my doctor.  
Nothing prepared me for the diagnosis: Stroke! Rather a mini-stroke or a (TIA) transient ischemic attack.  A TIA occurs when a blood clot temporarily clogs an artery, and part of the brain doesn't get the blood it needs. The symptoms occur rapidly, and most last less than five minutes. The average is about a minute. Unlike a stroke, when a TIA is over, there's no injury to the brain. Of the individuals whom have had one or more TIAs, more than a third will have a major stroke. Because you can experience a TIA and not know it; failure to receive immediate medical treatment makes it all the more frightening. 
Of all the ""conditions"" what my late father used to call his 'age-onset' illnesses that I knew that I was susceptible to, a stroke wasn't something I ever considered. Sure, somewhere in the back of my mind I realized that I was a candidate. After all, African Americans are more prone to strokes than other races. I suffer from hypertension where my blood pressure fluctuates from day to day. But I faithfully take my medication. 
Initially, suffering a TIA left me overwhelmed with a tsunami of emotions. Strokes aren't supposed to happen to someone whom folks say look much younger than she actually is, I think. Despite that one chin hair that continues to return, even after repeated plucking with industrial strength tweezers that a few months ago started to play hard ball by growing back gray.  Strokes aren't supposed to happen to someone who has finally realized a life-long dream of becoming a published author. 
Having survived a TIA has made me realize that strokes don't discriminate between age, gender or class. Strokes don't care whether you are politically aware or even politically correct. If anything good has come out of this health scare, it has renewed my zeal for living my truth/my purpose. Thus, I feel more self-protective of my dreams. 
In truth, having suffered a TIA has reminded me of what my mother always believed: that what does not kill you; indeed makes you stronger.

060009.txt,jessica,,18 - 30,"sterling, Illinois","February 18, 2009",2009,Acceptance of Myself,self-knowledge,"Acceptance of Myself 
 In my college years, I have come to accept myself for who I am and not who I thought I wanted to be. This means all parts of myself: my personality, my beliefs, and my physical appearance
	My personality comes in play at different places. When I am at school or at church I am very quiet and calm but when I'm with my friends other parts of my personality comes out. When my family goes to parties I can be myself because I feel comfortable around them. I spend the most time with my cousin Alex. Whenever I go to her family's house they know that we will be up all night laughing. We play pool, which we both suck at, but it's fun to play because it is guaranteed that one of us will bounce that ball off of the pool table.  We laugh about the ball bouncing off of the pool table for hours.
	My beliefs are another part of who I am. I go to church and spend time with my family. It's important to me to go to church. I listen to what the Father has to say and keep them into consideration. I spend as much time with my family as I can. We spend the most time during dinner, talking about our day at school or work. Dinner is the best part of my day because I get to spend time with my family.
	I have come to accept myself physically. I am not a small girl. In high school I hated myself because I was not skinny like the other girls. I tried dieting and eating less food. Then, in the beginning of my senior year in high school, I wasn't eating. I was losing some of the weight but I was getting sick at school. Well my mom found out that I wasn't eating during the day and only at dinner. My mom and I had a talk about me not eating and that it wasn't healthy. I realized that I was not going to be a size 5. I thought everyone would like to change something about his or her self. Now, I try and eat healthier and exercise as much as I can.  
	I have come to accept myself as a whole and love what I was given. My personality is funny and caring; I am now myself where ever I go. I don't have to hide the way that I am when I go out somewhere. I believe in God and going to church as much as possible.  The way that I feel about my physical appearance has changed over the past few years. I have become comfortable with my body. I love my body the way that it is.

060383.txt,Mary,,18 - 30,"Northvale, New Jersey","February 24, 2009",2009,Laughter,humor & laughter,"I believe in laughter.  Often called the best medicine, laughter has the ability to instantly wash away the troubles of a difficult day.  For me, there is no greater feeling than sitting down among friends after a long day and laughing.  It is as if through the process of laughing everything that is weighing on your mind is forgotten.  Suddenly it no longer matters that you failed a test, had a bad practice, or were stuck in hours of traffic.  If only for a moment, you are taken away from reality and allowed to clear your head and refresh your mind.  In this respect, I honestly believe laughter is an essential and necessary part of life.  
	The first moment in which I believed in the power of laughter likely dates back to the day my brother had his final spinal surgery.  After being called into the secretary's office at my grammar school, I was informed that my brother's surgery was running long.  Not completely understanding what this would mean for him, my eyes immediately filled with tears.  After composing myself, I returned to my classroom and sat down, but on the inside I was racing.  No matter how hard I tried, my mind was unable to rest as I constantly thought about him and whether or not he would be okay.  Unaware of what was going on or how I was feeling, my friends, along with the rest of my classmates, went outside for recess.  
	I distinctly remember not saying much while we were outside for I felt truly disconnected from my surroundings.  However, moments before the bell rang one of the guys in my class ran directly into a soccer net, full speed ahead as if he would be able to run righ t through the netting.  Obviously he didn't, but instead ended up getting caught upside down, hanging by one foot from the soccer net.  At the sight of him, I think everyone burst out laughing, including me.  In that instant, I realized how amazing laughter actually is and I have believed in it ever since.  Even though seconds before I felt worried and disheartened while I was laughing it was as if I didn't have a care in the world.  The emotional release I experienced that day as a result of laughter, as I said before, is a necessary part of life.  Laughter allows everyone, if only for a short time, a chance to forget everything and just enjoy the present moment.

I begin to draw a picture of what I hope this perfect day will encompass; beautiful flowers, stunning gowns, the bright sun shinning, and being surrounded by the ones I love.  As I think of my friends and family a tear falls onto the crisp white paper.  I wipe away the tears and wonder if my dad will still be alive to walk me down the aisle.  
	I drew that picture when I was ten years old.  I am now eighteen and constantly fear that my father will not be around to see his little girl get married.  My father, a fifty year old successful business man, supportive husband, and loving father has smoked ever since he was sixteen.  As far back as I can remember he has had a cigarette in his hand or a pack of Marlboro lights in his pocket. He promised me that he would quit this nasty habit, but he has yet to fulfill his promise.  I have fought with him numerous times asking him to stop and, while he has tried he has never been successful. Every time he lights up I know he is one puff closer to ending his life.
I understand that it is difficult to quit something you are accustomed to and have been doing your entire life, but I believe ending an addiction makes one stronger.  The word ""quitting"" usually has a cynical meaning, but when discussing an addiction ""quitting"" is positive and strongly encouraged.  Ending an addiction is a milestone.  It releases one from their ""jail cell"" and allows them to run free.  The jail cell, in this case, is their self.  That single habit inhibits them from a plethora of things, which they may not realize until the habit is kicked.  Breaking a habit builds character, and gives new-found confidence.  This confidence enables a person to create a new, positive lifestyle and live the life they truly wish to have.  Accomplishing a task that large has a great impact on the addict's life, as well as their friends and family.  The constant worrying and stressful environment is eliminated.  Although breaking a habit is an onerous task and very challenging, a battle occurs within yourself, ultimately making you a stronger person.

061449.txt,Ji Hye,,18 - 30,Romania,"March 9, 2009",2009,Pushing on to Success,self-determination,"I believe that perseverance is the key to success. Talent, time, resources, and determination are important, but with no perseverance, there is no success. Lack of perseverance is lack of success, I have felt it on my very skin as I lived in a foreign country with different everything. 
I moved to Romania at the age of three with my parents as missionaries. The first impression I got was- well, that everything was gray: sky, road, building, air. It was cold and strange, different from the place I had in Korea. It wasn't like I had to start all over because I was so young. I didn't start anything in Korea yet. Even if it was a cold and strange environment, I was open to learning many things. Of course, everything required a lot of effort and perseverance. Language, custom, culture- all was new to me. I had to give double effort to accomplish things that Romanian kids of my age did. This was frustrating but I had to keep trying. I had to persevere.
The difference became more evident as I entered Romanian middle school. I felt disappointed every time I got a lower grade than my classmates. The problem wasn't the grade. The real problem was that I had to put in effort to earn those grades- more effort than my classmates put. There was this girl who always hung out with friends and copied other people's homework on the next day. Despite her slacking off, she got the same grades as I did! Sometimes I really felt like giving up. It was hard to keep going, to persevere. The ""deathblow"" came to me when I received my score on the history midterm. I felt sick when I saw the score. I felt like crying when I saw the result of all my efforts: the lowest grade in class. This couldn't be happening. 
Things didn't always end in a bad way. Effort and perseverance gave their result in other areas like math and Romanian. I was satisfied with the results I got most of the time. But then, it was in my personality to remember the bad moments more than the good moments. I realized that if the effort I put wasn't enough, I just had to try harder. I needed to persevere in my work and show others what I was capable of. I had learned that this world is tough and that there is no room for laziness. This was the most important lesson I have learned so far living in this country. 
Through my experience I realized that success comes only to those who try and keep going on. It took a lot of effort for me to be the person I am today. I went through many hardships and many times I felt like giving up. As my mom said, ""God will help you, but you have to give your best first."" I believe that perseverance is a must and not an option for reaching success.

061617.txt,Heather,,Under 18,"Wauwatosa, Wisconsin","March 11, 2009",2009,Finding Happiness in Divorce,change;family;setbacks,"The word divorce has a very negative connotation. In our society divorce is associated with arguing, pain, emotionally hurting children, and destroying a family. I think just the opposite. I associate divorce with less arguing, relief of pain, and helping children. I believe divorce does not ruin a family but bring it back together. 
Some of my earliest memories are of my parents fighting. I remember several accounts where I would lie in bed at night, listening to my parents arguing and then one of them would come and tell me everything was okay. Do not get me wrong; I have many happy memories of my family. Most of the time everything was fine and everyone was happy but I still have bitter memories of sadness in my mind mixed in with all the good memories.
When I was around eight years old my parents called my brother and I into the kitchen. Somehow I had a bad feeling about what was about to happen as I sat down at the kitchen table. My parents then announced that they were getting a divorce confirming the bad feeling I had but I did not want to be true.
The next weeks, months, and even year were very hard and filled with sadness. Eventually my dad found a new house and we settled into our new way of life. It took a very long time for me to realize my parents would not get back together again but when I came to terms with reality I was able to see my situation in a new light. I was able to see that my parents' getting a divorce was a good thing.
There certainly is less arguing. My parents sit next to each other at my soccer games and brother's basketball games. My parents still argue once in a while but it is nothing compared to when they were together. I am thankful that they get along.
I am happier too. Everyone in my family is happier. Rather than being surrounded by arguing I am surrounded by love and happiness. My dad is remarried and my mom has a boyfriend. I see my parents and I know they are both happier.
My family is also much closer. My family has set up a system of fifty/fifty custody; because of this I am able to spend equal time with each parent. Now I feel like I am able to enjoy the time I spend with each of my parents more. 
Although from the outside it looks like my family has been split in two, I feel that I have two families. I have two houses and two safe havens. I have two families that love me and for that I am grateful.
Divorce can be very painful at first but once the pain subsides life is happier for everyone involved. I wish society would realize that divorce is not always a bad thing and can bring a family back together.

061627.txt,Xiu Ping,,18 - 30,"Boston, Massachusetts","March 11, 2009",2009,This I Believe,family;love,"Opening up a dictionary, my index finger moves down the page as my eyes scan the page to find the word love. ""Love is a feeling of strong or constant affection towards a person"", this is how a dictionary defines ""love"". However, love contains bitterness, tears and a lot unspeakable meanings to me. My mamma has spent eighteen years trying to teach me what love is. 
In my earliest memory, there were only two colors in my family: black and grey. Black was when my mamma and my papa broke into wars from squabbles; when my papa raised his overwhelming voice, shouting at mamma; when mamma cried out and was absent from dinner; when I sobbed alone in bed, my head covered by my quilt. Papa's furious voice made me tremble with fear and mamma's desperate cry made me heartbreak.  Grey was when mamma and papa's fight cooled down and turned into a cold war, where no one talked or laughed. The fighting held on, in tension. Occasionally a cry from my little cat broke the silence. 
One day, after a war with papa, mamma grabbed me and put her arms around me. Tears dropped down her face. She talked about herself in the third person. ""Mamma stays in this family just because mamma doesn't want to leave you alone. Mama doesn't want your buddies look down on you…"" she tried to continue but her throat was stuck with sobs. A few minutes later, she continued:"" Papa and mamma are shui huo bu rong (means ""things or persons that are irreconcilable, such as fire and water""). You papa is like a tyrant… He never respects mamma's ideas. Mamma, in this family, is no better than in a prison."" She held me tightly, shedding her tears. My body stayed stiff, but I didn't want to move. 
Later on, I knew that mamma did have many opportunities to break free from her ""trap"". Mamma's father and many other close relatives were in Hong Kong, a much more prosperous place than TaiShan, a city in Canton Province, China, where we lived. Mamma had a chance to move to Hong Kong and find a job there, but maternal love pulled mamma back. She stayed, even though papa only earned a few hundred yuan (approximately one hundred U. S. dollars) per month working as an electrician.  
Mamma didn't divorce because she wanted to protect me from getting hurt emotionally. In China, especially in cities where urbanization is just in germination, people are quite bao shou (means ""not open-minded""), and divorce is a shameful thing. Children of divorced parents are teased and humiliated. Mamma didn't want me to have the feeling of desertion. Though she felt tortured by her situation, she sustained, so that I could have my favored foods when I got home from school; I could get praise from her when I got 100 in my math test; I could have a secure heart to sleep with at night. Having a mamma, I would not be degraded, and I would not have to hide myself when other children who had mothers bragged about their mammas.
In the dictionary, the definition of love is too superficial to describe my mamma's love. I can't describe it, either, because my mamma's love is unspeakable. This ""unspeakable"" is of its Chinese meaning ""zhi ke yi hui, bu ke yan biao"", which means having gratitude to a degree where feelings can only be felt by hearts, but can't be described by words. What I can definitely say is: maternal love is the most invaluable love in the world. This is what I believe the most.

061958.txt,Kaelyn,,Under 18,"COlumbus, New Jersey","March 18, 2009",2009,"When You Learn How To Be Fair, You Carry That With You Forever…",equality,"A question that I am always asked is, 'What do I believe in?' The truth is, I believe in many things! But the thing I believe in the most… I believe in fairness.
	Being that I am a 14 year old girl, I still have a lot to learn and a lot to face. Therefore, believing in something, you will not put your belief aside for anyone, no matter the age. This is how I feel about fairness.
	Fairness shows up everywhere- school, homes, sports, etc. –everywhere. As children, we are taught what is fair, and are expected to apply it to our everyday lives. If there are 4 children and four lollipops, we are taught that it is fair for each child to get one, and not to let one child take three for him. As we grow a little older, this concept continues…  It is not fair to always get your way, or it is not fair for two people to do the same thing and only one get in trouble, etc. Once we learn how to do things in a way that is fair, we are able to get things done and everyone involved is happy. Unfortunately, some people are not always fair.
	Recently, I have faced some problems where I learned that people don't always do things in a fair way. At soccer, there is a rule that if you are not at practice, you do not start the game. However, this rule is not always applied to everyone. On my soccer team, there is a girl that never shows up for our practices, and yet she starts every game and also plays the whole time. For the rest of the girls, that are showing up to the practices, but are not getting the same playing time or aren't starting games, this is unfair. Also, there was a time where I personally had an argument with one of my own teammates because she had been yelling at me throughout the game and criticizing my playing, but when I said something back to her, my coach yelled at me, ""If you have nothing nice to say to her, that you shouldn't say anything at all."" I felt that this was very unfair because although I explained to him that she has started with me, I was still the only one disciplined.
	It's important for people of all ages to include fairness in their decisions. When you're a little kid, you learn how to be fair and you carry that with you forever. If all people applied fairness to their decisions, then the world would be a better place. Throughout my life, I will make sure that when I need to make a decision on something that I choose the thing that is fair and I hope that others do the same.

062125.txt,Frederick,,50 - 65,"Orlando, Florida","March 20, 2009",2009,An open letter to President Obama,social justice,"Dear President Obama:
When I was growing up, a long time ago, there was a kid in my neighborhood who was very good at playing marbles. He was so good that he eventually won all of the marbles from the rest of us. Nobody saw it coming. Since our parents didn't have the money to buy more marbles to ""bail us out,"" marble playing came to an abrupt halt.
Over the years I have found that it works the same way with economics. When only a few people hold all the ""marbles"" no one else can play the game.
That marble hoarding kid has grown up. Over the years, he and a few of his friends worldwide have ""played the game"" with economics. They have manipulated the game so that they have collected all of the ""marbles."" 
A search of the Internet for ""Wealth in the United States,"" reveals that over the years this manipulation has resulted in more then 90% of the wealth now being concentrated in the hands of less then 10% of the people. An article that appeared in The New York Times states: ""If the statements recently made in this city by Henry Laurens Call before the American Association for the Advancement of Science are true, the concentration of wealth in this country has reached such a pitch that the most radical measures might well be invoked. Mr. Call holds that 99 per cent. of the wealth of the United States is in the hands of 1 per cent. of its population. This, he declares, is a complete reversal of the conditions existing fifty years ago, when there were only fifty millionaires in the entire country, and their fortunes, with those of the men worth $500.000, did not exceed 1 per cent. of the total wealth of the Nation. To-day, he says, there are 800,000 persons in the millionaire class, who hold over 90 per cent. of the National wealth.""
As you may have guessed by the numbers, this article appeared some time ago. It appeared on January 6, 1907. That's twenty years before the collapse of Wall Street and the Great Depression.
Current statistics reveal that we reached that same financial critical mass some time ago. (see: www.lcurve.org ) The real estate collapse is only a symptom of the greed that has taken over our financial institutions. If we are to avoid another great depression, we must all get back into playing the economic game. To do that, we have to redistribute the ""marbles.""
If 90% of the wealth is in the hands of less then 6% of the people, that means that the rest of us, 94% of the population, are battling over the 10% that's left. It also means that all we have to do is get that small percent of rich people to give back 10% of the national wealth and the rest of us will all have twice as much! They will still have 80% of the wealth, nothing to sneeze at, while the rest of us will now have twice as much to work with.
We have all seen that trickle down economics has been a big lie to justify the collection of all the marbles by a greedy few. It gives hope to those who think that they too can make it rich. Unfortunately, over time, the wealth has become more and more concentrated into fewer and fewer hands. This leads to a form of royalty for the privileged few while the infrastructure of the country falls into ruin. This is the type of situation that led to the French Revolution!
What we need is trickle up economics. You are correct to tax the rich with a progressive tax. Perhaps Willie Sutton said it best. When asked why he robbed banks, Sutton simply replied, ""Because that's where the money is."" When we have Billionaires making over 65 Billion dollars a year, they are the ones who can best afford to bail out the economy. (Why aren't they doing more on their own? Or, are they really the ones who are trying to get even more money from the rest of us through these devious manipulations of the economy?)
This concentration of wealth is nothing new. If you read Leviticus 25:8-55, you will find that God outlined a series of seven year plans; a fifty year plan; and a hundred year jubilee plan. It appears that we are at the point where we need a hundred year jubilee, where all debts are forgiven, if we are ever to get back to a stable economy.

062384.txt,Cindy,,30 - 50,"Beaverton, Oregon","March 25, 2009",2009,The Power of a Solid Yellow Line,self-determination,"We have all heard the old adage: Patience is a Virtue.  Why is it a virtue?  Do we gain anything by being patient?  Or, looking at it another way, can you lose something by being impatient?  Yes, you can.  I believe that one person's impatience almost led to another person's death. My death.
      In the state of Oregon, a day trip to the beach in quite common.  For most of us city dwellers, an hour and a half trip over winding roads and the cascade mountain pass will bring us to the serene and calming Pacific Ocean.  However, the traffic congestion, especially during the summer, is anything but calming.  Traffic gets backed up as campers and trailers move slowly along the winding highway.  There are a few areas which allow passing, but for most of the trip, a  solid-yellow line declares that passing is not only dangerous, but illegal.  I have seen people illegally pass a camper by crossing a solid yellow line as their impatience got the best of them. Those crazy daredevils, I would think to myself, and then just brush it off.  Two summers ago, however, one of those crazy daredevils almost took my life.
     My daughter, Lauren, and I were returning to Portland from a camping trip along the coast.  I was winding my way along highway 30, leaving Astoria, when I started to go through the winding mountain pass back toward Portland.  I glanced left, at on-coming traffic, and saw a large RV moving slowly up the hill, the long back-up of cars behind it.  In an instant I glanced back in front of me, and my heart leapt as I realized that something was wrong.  A car was coming toward me in my lane, my lane….in front of me…two young men with panic in their eyes as they realized that their efforts to pass the RV had failed.  I lifted my foot off the gas, instinctively, but didn't swerve right or left.  I prayed, ""God, please take both of us.""  In that moment, when everything seemed to go in slow motion, I didn't want to survive if my daughter died, and I didn't want her to live without her mother by her side.  That's all I was thinking….take both of us…
     In an instant, the car veered left onto the gravel shoulder and skidded out of view, missing my car by a few inches.  The cars continued behind the RV on the left, the daredevils skidded out to my right, and my car went right on through the middle, untouched.  I started shaking, felt sick to my stomach, and looked for a way to turn off the road as soon as possible.  When I was finally able to pull over, I fell over the steering wheel in prayer, Thank you Lord for saving our lives.  I will never forget this. My daughter, meanwhile, kept watching the DVD player with her headphones on, oblivious to our close call.  I felt it was best not to tell her, at least for a while.
     For the next few weeks I woke up every night with panic attacks, seeing a car in my dreams coming straight at me.  The next summer when I drove along that stretch of highway,  I looked closely at the road and discovered that the shoulder widened at that exact stretch of road only for about 50 feet, allowing those young men at that exact moment to pull onto the shoulder and avoid hitting me or killing themselves. Lucky?  Yes. A coincidence? No.  I was meant to survive that close call. God still has plans for my life.
     The next time you see a solid-yellow line that means ""No Passing,"" be patient and know that the law is there to protect you and to protect other drivers.  Patience is a virtue.  Patience also saves lives.

062479.txt,Elizabeth,,50 - 65,"Boulder, Colorado","March 27, 2009",2009,Death of Fear,birth;brotherhood & friendship;death;fear;values & spirituality,"I believe that fear can be overcome.
Many years ago, I was about to embark on an overseas airline flight, and in my moments of anxiety just prior to the flight, a friend said that what I needed to do was reconcile myself with the possibility of dying.  At the time, this only served to frighten me more.
In the ensuing years, I gradually learned to distract myself from fearful thoughts as I flew, to turn my mind away from fantasies of carnage and mayhem, and focus it instead on the beauty of the clouds, or the phenomenon of what I could see below. I learned that the fear that had gripped me existed in my imagination, and that I could imagine something else instead.  Still, this was not reconciling myself with dying; it was a step in the right direction in terms of conquering my fear, but it was more in the direction of realizing the unlikelihood of my perishing in a plane crash, than really accepting the possibility of that happening.
Some years ago, my friend Amy was diagnosed with breast cancer, just prior to her 40th birthday.  During the months of treatment that followed, she felt that cancer was something that she would endure and overcome.  But three years later it was evident that the cancer had not been overcome.  Amy went through all the treatments that were available to her, while at the same time pursuing her spiritual practice and accepting what befell her as it unfolded.  I remember her telling me during that time that suffering cannot be avoided, but it always ends.
Nearly three years later, having pursued all the available treatments and then giving herself over to the ending of her life, Amy died.  Through the process of witnessing her gracious departure from life, I was able to appreciate all she had given me in her friendship, in her living and teaching, and in her dying.  She taught me that dying is unavoidable, that each of us has our own death in the same way that we have our own face and character, and that the value of a life is not measured by its length. 
I believe that in leaving those of us who loved her, Amy taught us to embrace the life we're given and to release it when we must.  That there are forces beyond our comprehension that dictate these things.  Ultimately, that dying is as natural as breathing.  There is this intellectual knowledge that we all die, but Amy helped me to know on a personal level that it really does happen to each and every one of us, and that it is not a tragedy.
So now when I fly, and indeed in every act of my life, I have this knowledge that what my friend said to me so many years ago is true; once we embrace death as the natural, inevitable, and often beautiful passage that it is, the fear resolves.

062589.txt,Jessica,,18 - 30,"Beijing, China","March 30, 2009",2009,Studying makes us satisfied,education & knowledge,"I believe studying makes a person satisfied, which is to say that if I have more lessons to learn, I'll have no time to think of nonsense. Then I'll pay more attention to my courses and achieve my goals.
I used to think that only recreation can please people. I could play computer games, watch TV, go shopping and hang out with friends. I could forget the burdens we Chinese students endure. Especially on holidays with less homework to do, I slept late , got up late, and occupied all my leisure time with everything except studying. Sometimes, I just sat in front of the computer, surfed the Internet, and visited websites which didn't even interest me at all.
I had spent my summer and winter holidays in this way for nearly 19 years. Instead of happiness, I felt a void in my life. Last winter holiday, I stayed at home for only 5 days and stayed in Beijing for the rest of the holiday. Unlike my previous holidays, I attended an English course in Neworiental, which is one of the most prominent language schools in Beijing. My whole family was extraordinarily surprised when they heard my decision. ""Are you serious?"" ""What's wrong?"" ""Do you have a boyfriend in Beijing so that you won't be back?"" were the most frequently asked questions by my relatives and good friends. Actually, I just wanted to spend this holiday differently by keeping myself busy.
Everyday in last winter holiday, I got up at 7:30 AM, washed my face, rinsed my mouth and hurried to my class, which began at 8:30 AM and ended at 2:00 in the afternoon. After the class was over, I would go to a café near my college, reviewing what I had learned that day until around 7:00 PM. Stepping out of the café with full understanding of my work was the most delightful thing I had ever experienced. Instead of hanging out with nothing to do, I learned more and felt more contented last winter holiday.
In the past, it was a mystery to me why I always felt unsatisfied, though I played all the day. Now I get the answer—for there was nothing I could put my heart into in earnest. The saying goes that ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."" It is also true, however, when the saying is modified to: ""All play and no work makes me a depressed girl."" After the long but cheerful days, I have found the real self-satisfaction I have been pursuing for years.
The key to being contented is gaining new knowledge rather than advancing through the levels of a new computer game. This is the lesson I learned last winter holiday. We need to learn, we need to occupy ourselves with something really valuable.
I do believe studying will bring us pleasure and make us satisfied.

062679.txt,Emili,,Under 18,"Port Trevorton, Pennsylvania","April 1, 2009",2009,This I Believe,tolerance,"I believe in tolerance, in the belief that it is one's character that defines him, not his sexual orientation, skin color, religion, or even wealth. I feel that judgments should not be made about an individual without even saying one word to him. Open minds is what this ever changing world needs as cultures become even greater prevalent. The earth craves for tolerance. It is just as a necessity as oxygen or fresh water. However, it is unfortunately not always regarded with as much emphasis. 
	I experienced lack of tolerance first hand. Last summer I traveled to Harrisburg's Pride Day to support a friend who did not want to go alone. The streets were packed with rainbow banners, rainbow balloons, and rainbow flags.  You name it, it was manufactured in rainbow. The morning parade was a blast as the streets stretched from east to west with an all accepting, tolerant crowd. However, we were not so lucky to remain surrounded by these open minds. Our brief rainbow euphoria was abruptly ended when a harsh man's voice boomed over a megaphone harsh criticisms and judgments I would not even wish upon my worst enemy. ""You're going to Hell!"" he screamed, his voice growing hoarse. It was in this instant that my heart dropped to my stomach. Not only did my heart go out to my friend, directly targeted by his attack, but it also caused great uneasiness in my own body. I am by no means gay. I am one hundred percent heterosexual without a doubt in my mind. However, as I walked down the cracked sidewalk I could feel the pain as this stranger thrust me into the shoes of another individual. This man did not know me. He was ignorant of the fact that I have dedicated much of my time helping the poor, that I attend church every Sunday, and that I genuinely hope to make a difference in this world. But none of this mattered. In his hasty generalization he saw me as one thing, a homosexual. He branded me with his first glance. I was selfishly angered by his fast comments to me, but what about those who were homosexual? He spoke as if they were diseased, infected. Personally, I felt that my barely one hundred and thirty pound, red headed friend, dressed in a tight pink polo, was more of a man than the body that belonged to the screaming voice would ever be. 
	Tolerance is easy to ignore and disregard when you are not the one being judged. However, I guarantee it will only take one a brief thirty seconds in the position of the victim receiving the hasty judgments to realize its true importance and necessity. I believe in tolerance because what truly lies within the soul of an individual is not discernable by height, weight, skin color, or whom they fall in love with. Who am I to say that they are wrong?

062829.txt,Aaron,,18 - 30,"Hudson, Ohio","April 4, 2009",2009,The Magic of Childhood,children,"I believe in the magic of childhood. The first of my many fond memories on the subject begins in Tampa Florida in a development named Westchase. As a kid, it was paradise. The houses were small and cheap and almost exactly identical to one another.  They were a perfect fit for families who wanted to buy their very first house. Not only was this beneficial to the heads of the household, but it was also a godsend for their kids. Almost every house provided a playmate and as a slightly chubby six year old, I took full advantage. Every day was an adventure. We would catch the tropical frogs that stuck to the windows every morning and play football in the streets that were perpetually warmed by the sun. Each day the ice cream man would drive around in his little white truck and not understanding the concept of money but knowing that the candy and cold treats that he provided could be traded for the green slips of paper, it was an easy decision. Did I mention no give backs? The ice cream man always seemed pleased with our trades. Disaster struck when I found out that my dad had gotten a job offer in Cleveland, Ohio to work at its Art Museum. Besides there being a temperature difference, I later learned that the friends that I grew up with would not be leaving with me. As our car began to make the trip out of Westchase for the last time, I took one last look back only to find my friend Marco on his bike yelling after me. He stretched out his left arm as if to pull me back, but he could only keep up for so long and soon was left behind in a cloud of exhaust. 
                I lived in Shaker Heights for a little over a year and then moved to Hudson, and just like in Florida, I found myself surrounded by an amazing group of friends. Those warm summer days provide some of my fondest memories: skipping rocks at the pond, playing games in the woods so often that most of us became immune to the poison ivy that covered the ground beneath. We used to sleep outside at night and gaze at the stars. Things were so wonderful and carefree that I never wanted them to end but of course they did. I was accepted into WRA and eventually lost contact with the friends who before I held so dear. For the longest time I blamed myself for leaving everyone behind. Of course none of this was in my control and now I understand that. What makes childhood so endearing is that it has to end. It is limited and therefore special. 
  One day my friends and I walked outside after a heavy rainstorm to find a gigantic rainbow that seemed to take up a whole half of the sky. Because the Lucky Charms' leprechaun promised us riches at its end, we ran and ran, and yet the more we did this, the fainter it became. Right then and there I remembered Marco and how he chased after me. How he never gave up and followed my car until it reached the end of the development where his parents had set an imaginary yet all-powerful boundary. He was young but not naive. He had to have known that there was no way his small bike could catch our four cylinder car. So why did he try and at the same time, why were my friends and I chasing this ever fading rainbow? I believe that among all children that there is an unspoken rule: do not fear the impossible. As all of us age we also grow in our skepticism and cynicism just because supposedly we are better informed about the world around us. In part this is true but as a result, the sense of wonder that we all once had as children disappears. It was for this reason that even when that rainbow disappeared and our chance at a pot of gold dwindled to zero my friends and I kept running. Without a care in the world we kept going. I believe that always to move forward disregarding the harsh realities that life throws at us is a lesson that can only come from one's youth. It is the magic of childhood.

062965.txt,Sharon,,50 - 65,"Stone Mountain, Georgia","April 8, 2009",2009,My Apology to Parents Everywhere,children,"My Apology To Parents Everywhere!
We are a nation divided by kids – those with and those without.  It is a big divide, in part because those of us without kids don't get it.  Once babies come on the scene, our friends change forever.  Former bar buddies forget what it's like to be a non-breeder.  They won't come out to play anymore.  
I'm part of a demo that says kids are just fine, as long as they're quiet and belong to someone else.   My brother, on the other hand, has two boys and a girl, all under the age of 12.  When he called to see if I'd watch them for five days I panicked. 
I tried babysitting for only two days, and it was a disaster.  On the first night my brother's beloved beagle ran out in a thunderstorm.  Wearing nightgown and slippers, I chased him through the woods, dodging lightning bolts and using all the words that children should not hear.
Then there were the food issues.  I often preach about parents letting kids watch too much TV, play too many video games, and eat too much junk food.  So I fixed a stir fried chicken dish.  Zach looked at my pan of carefully chopped vegetables and cage free organically blessed chicken like it was something from a horror movie.  ""I want chicken nuggets,"" he said.  None of them would touch my healthy food.
When at last it was bedtime, I realized 6 year old Ryan planned to sleep with me.  I was rather touched, as those of us who don't have children tend to be when a child seems to adore us.  But I woke up mid-morning to the sting of a kick. His entire 45 pound body was sprawled across the pillows with his feet aimed at my head.  The dog, that cursed dog, wound up on top of my shins.  I could not move, I could not sleep, I could not remember why I had agreed to this.  
So now, perhaps, you understand why this latest request for a five day stint put me in a quandary.  But how do you say no to your brother?  I packed my bags and drove 11 hours to Maryland.  
Day 1 my arrival served as a good excuse for everyone to stay up later than normal.  The sleeping arrangements were the same as last time:  a 6 year old and a beagle in bed with Aunt Sharon.  The dog is now too fat to jump onto the bed, so once Ryan was asleep I tried to sneak in.  But the Raskal was whining and threatening to bark.  So I lifted his tubby, arthritic body onto the mattress, gritted my teeth, and eventually dozed off.
Day 2 started at 6:30 am.  Both boys had soccer camp.  All three kids began yelling breakfast orders while I stumbled around trying to make coffee.  Barbie pancakes, Cinnamon crispy something, frozen waffles, frozen pancakes, chocolate milk with Ovaltine, chocolate milk with syrup.  I'm not making this up.  
By 7 am the 12 year old was in front of the computer playing an online  game with obnoxious background music.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, pause, bum, bum, bum, bum, pause, dah, dah.  Repeat.  For the entire five days I was there, Zach played this game over and over.  It never stopped and I couldn't get that horrible sound out of my head.  On the other hand, it kept him occupied. 
Here's the embarrassing part.  Despite my holier than thou criticism of parents who let their kids to spend too much time in front of TV or computer screens, in just one day I was allowing non-stop video games and back to back Scooby Doo movies.  My pitiful excuse?  I just wanted to finish a cup of coffee.  It never happened.
Later the two smaller ones were joined by a neighborhood friend.  The three of them were everywhere at once.  I'd look at the sandbox, they'd be in the kitchen.  They were back and forth, in and out.  There's an alarm on all the doors so each time one opened I heard 'bing-bing'.  The house was constant movement and sound.  The boom boom background music from Scooby Doo, 'bing-bing', bum, bum, bum, bum, pause, bum, bum, bum, bum, pause, dah, dah, 'bing-bing', boom boom.
We childless folks don't truly appreciate the value of silence until it's gone.  I began to feel like the Grinch, ""Oh, the noise! noise! noise! noise!""  I started dreaming about 5:00 and a glass of wine.  Dinner tonight – pizza.  I looked at the clock.  It was only 2:00 and I was fading.
Day 3 started even earlier.  Plans to read the paper died fast.  Kids ask a lot of questions.  ""Um, um, Aunt Sharon, um, Aunt Sharon, um, how fast does your car go?"" I said, ""It goes more than a hundred miles an hour.""  ""Um, Aunt Sharon, Aunt Sharon, um, well, well, do you drive that fast?""  I said, ""No, it's against the law.""  ""Well, um, Aunt Sharon, um, how come your car goes a hundred miles an hour if it's against the law?""  I said, ""Because God made it so.""  Yeah, yeah, I know.  I'm a bad aunt.  In my defense, I had tried to read the same sentence 15 times and now realized reading was not an option.   
At this point I heard Holly whimpering.  She wanted Mommy.  I realized Aunt Sharon wasn't exciting anymore as I paced the room and she cried for mom.  But I knew what to do.  Scooby Doo.  Fifteen minutes later she was curled up with her doll, a blanket and the lovely sound of Scooby.
Day 4 was a Saturday and the lack of sleep was getting to me.  Their trash can is behind a cabinet door with a childproof latch which I forgot about each of the 100 times I opened it.  This morning I came close to ripping it off.
By 7:30am I was in Holly's room having an imaginary tea party.  I was so tired I saw her imaginary friends.  Then we watched a cartoon with dancing hippos, or maybe that was a hallucination.  Due to the lack of sleep and coffee I was no longer sure.   
Day 5 the parents were due home.  I gave Holly a bubble bath so they'd think everything went smoothly.  In truth, none of the kids had had a bath in five days.  What can I say?  The boys went swimming which seemed like a suitable cleansing.  Holly splashed in her little pool and that qualified for a bath of sorts.  
Now the clan was clean but restless.  I caught Ryan and Holly using decorative plants to stage a sword fight.  I made them to stop.  Ryan threw his plant-sword on the ground.  I said, ""Ryan, you pick that up and put it back where you found it – NOW.""  Off he stomped and I felt old and mean.  I had just parented.  It was harder than I thought.  Aunt Sharon was supposed to be fun, not mean.   
My brother and his wife returned home around dinner time and I quickly escaped to my little Z3.  As I drove, I thought about how long those days had been, and how all consuming the demands of three children can be.   Despite the lack of sleep, peace and martinis, I don't regret a minute.  It has turned a relationship based on birthday cards and Christmas gifts into a much more meaningful bond with my nephews and niece.  It also knocked me off my soapbox.  I get it now.
Just don't ask me to do it again.

I tried smoking, drinking, and having sexual intercourse. I tried not to be so independent and started hanging out with friends more. On my 14th birthday, I was invited to a party. There is when I started drinking a lot and sometimes even on school nights. After some time, I found out I was pregnant. I thought all my dreams of becoming a nurse, doctor, or a teacher were gone. I started skipping school and planning to have a baby; however, there was still hope because I found a school that helped teens with babies with day care in it. I went back to school my sophomore year. Four months later, I had my beautiful baby boy, Ethan. It was hard because I got through it all own my own.
When Ethan turned three months old, we found out, he had a hole in his heart. The doctor said it was normal and it would close on its own with a little help from some medication. However, when Ethan was a month elder I took him back to the doctor for his check up and his heart did not close yet. I took him to another doctor and he said it was not normal so he set up an appointment.
Ethan was ten months old when we got his appointment. The doctor saw Ethan, did some test, and came back telling us that he was going to be rushed into emergency open heart surgery; otherwise, he was not going to live. The doctor said, ""No news is good news."" She also told us that his heart would have never closed on its own. Eight hours later he came out of it okay, except, now his lung pressures were up and they did not know why. They did more testing and diagnosed him with PPH (Primary Pulmonary Hypertension). They told me he has a life expectancy of 18 years old. I thought I was going to die right there.
One month later, I could not stop thinking about what the doctor had told me that day. As a result, I started dealing with it in the wrong way. I started drinking and partying again. After two years, of the same nonsense life, I ended up pregnant again. I thought to myself it was time to change once and for all. I went back to school and finally graduated with the support of my family. 
On June 1, 2006, I gave birth to my second child, Erionna. I had my own little family now, and I would not change it for anything in the world. Now, I have a job, I am trying to get my college degree, and I am engaged. My family is my support and my kids are my life.

063143.txt,Kayla,,Under 18,"Mt.Sterling, Kentucky","April 14, 2009",2009,I believe in Being a Leader,self-determination,"This I Believe…
I believe in standing up and being a leader for others in the everyday life. It could be a time where a basketball team is at a state game hoping to win the title. Then and there you need a leader to step up and help the team out. Or it can be in the classroom on an ordinary day. Being a leader means setting an example for others and doing the right thing. There should always be a leader or a role model for everything you might possible be involved in.
For example, a couple of months ago I was at cheerleading practice for the junior team. This is a team for kids that are in fourth to eighth grade. I was and always am on task and not talking during cheerleading practice, which is a surprise to some people, but true. During practice Coach Tricia let us take a drink break and also lets us rest for a little bit. But while we were taking a break she sat down and talked to us. She said that practice had been going poorly today. She made a comment to all of us saying that there was an eighth grader trying to lead the team and that she couldn't do it all by herself. When she said that I got butterflies in my stomach. She asked everyone whom they had thought she was, then everyone looked at me and they all said ""Kayla"" at the same time. I felt kind of embarrassed and my face got red as an apple. But it made me feel wonderful that my teammates knew that I was trying to step up and be a leader.
My Coach came up to me after practice and said, ""those girls look up to you, Kayla and today I was so proud of you. You set an example, and all those girls realized what they needed to do to be successful during practice. Thanks!"" I again felt like I done a good thing but my face got red again. I got all choked up. But I nodded and smiled gratefully because she had recognized my hard work.
On the floor I am not anyone's friend, I am just a strictly get-things-done-and-go-home-kind of cheerleader. I am really serious. But off the floor I am fun and awesome to be around. But I know I have to set an example on the mat and off the mat, too. I am a role model to them. It's hard sometime but it makes me feel good inside that I am doing something right.
At that moment at practice I was a leader to all them other girls. At that very moment, on that very day, on that very hour was the time that I had found out that others look up to me. It was an amazing feeling that I will never forget.

063341.txt,Lacey,,18 - 30,"McGregor, Texas","April 19, 2009",2009,The Power of Love,love,"I believe that love brings out the best in a person. Love challenges you and teaches you things about yourself that you did not know were there. I also believe that a lack of love is a tragedy and can have negative effects on people. I believe in the power of love.
I have experienced many types of love in my lifetime: love between siblings, friends, and parents as well as love for hobbies and interests. The greatest love in my life, however, is the love that my family has for each other. My family shows me love through encouragement, praise, and sometimes, in the case of my parents, through discipline. My mom always says ""I'm only doing this because I love you."" As a young child I didn't believe that at all, thinking she was just being mean. Now that I am older, I realize that she was giving me strict rules because she and my dad love and care about me. It is through their love that I am the person I am today. The love that I have received and witnessed between them has empowered me to seek the same kind of relationship in the future. 
Victory is always sweeter when you have someone you love to share it with. My friends and family have encouraged me through love to do things I never thought I would be able to do. When I was seven years old, I climbed a pamper pole for the first time. Standing on a small box fifty feet in the air was beyond terrifying. I was supposed to jump off of the box and try to catch a hanging trapeze, but I was paralyzed by fear. I did not think I would be able to do it until I heard my friends and family shouting from below ""we love you lacey; you can do this!"" I jumped off less than a minute later. If it was not for the love and encouragement I received in that moment, I would have climbed down defeated. If no one cared whether I jumped or not, I wouldn't care either. It is through this love that I feel like I can do anything.
Love is a powerful thing. It can be used to build someone up and cause someone to strive for greatness. Lack of it can break someone down and make one feel like there is no point in trying their best if no one is going to care whether they succeed or not. In many cases, love can be the determining factor in drive, determination, and self-belief. This I believe.

063578.txt,Marissa,,Under 18,"Surprise, Arizona","April 22, 2009",2009,I believe in,equality;love,"This I believe; that no one should be limited or shunned because of who they love. You should be able to be with whoever you want, woman or man. You shouldn't have to worry about being ridiculed or talked about when you show affection to your significant other. I'm not saying by any means that it's right, but its okay. If you're religious, yes the bible says Man should be with Woman, and if you just have really good morals, it just doesn't seem right for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals to exist. But love is out of human control. 
     Have you ever fallen for a guy and you didn't want to have feelings for him? You can't cut off your feelings, no matter what you do, for a time being; those feelings will still be there. I'm sure it's the same for all of the gays. Yes it's a sin, but so are piercings, tattoos, and lying, and so much of that's easily accepted in the world today. No sin is greater than another, if you can have your ears pierced, why's it so hard to accept that homosexuality exists? It's not your life, seeing two people of the same gender together isn't going to cause the world to end, it has no affect on your life, unless of course you're homosexual. 
      What's there to resent about seeing people happy together?  Everyone has the right to be happy, with whoever they want to be with. I believe if you can forgive anyone for making a sin, being gay should be a part of that. The percentage of homosexuality is rising in the U.S. One in four Americans are homosexual, bisexual, or lesbian. If you have three best friends and one day they all come to you with secrets, one is gay, one is bisexual, and one is lesbian. How do you handle that situation? Sure you can sit them down, explain to them how wrong and how un-normal it is for them to be that way, but truth is, it's not going to change a single thing. 
      No one should have to live a life of a lie, in fear that if they were to be themselves and let people know that they are indeed homosexual, then they would lose everything. Everyone has the right to be themselves, to be comfortable in their own skin, to be happy, to be loved, and to love. No matter who makes them happy, who loves them or who they love. 
      This I believe, that one day everyone will accept the world that we live in, where everyone can truly be happy and know that they have the freedom to love someone of the same gender and not worry about what might happen to them because of it. I believe that they won't be looked down upon, that we will look around and see many smiling faces and couples. Couples made up of man and man, woman and man, and woman and woman.

063599.txt,Lance,,Under 18,"Applecreek, Ohio","April 22, 2009",2009,This I Believe,Christianity,"This I believe … 
 I believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for my sin.  This is the only the basic of my religion, Christianity.  Believing Jesus secures my salvation and allows me to go to heaven when I die.  This essay is all about why it is important to me and how it has changed my life. 
The first time that I really started thinking about being a Christian was when my pastor asked me, ""Do you want to join our family of Christians?""  I thought about it and then I answered that I would believe in Jesus and commit my life to him.  It didn't really start there though.  I was raised in a Christian home and they had a huge positive influence on me.  I remember every year on Mother's Day my grandma was asked what she was thankful for and every year she replied "" I am thankful that Jesus has saved my soul and given me this loving family.""  Just like my grandma the rest of my family has the same Godly outlook on life.  
Another influence on me was my family's weekly attendance to church.  The environment that the church gives off is a very positive one.  What I mean is that the smiling faces and joyful singing makes people forget everything that even made them upset over the week.  This is only one example of the outreach a church family can have.  My favorite of all the outreaches is in the missionary ministries.  When I was younger I really wanted to be a missionary to China and that is still an option for my future but I am not sure.  Anyway when missionaries come back and tell us about the tear streamed faces of the people that they are helping and the big, cheek wide smiles of the kids showing their gratitude, it makes me fell like I can even do that.  
	Well the religion of Christianity is what I try to base my life around.  It is important to me that the people I come in contact find out the good news of Jesus Christ.  My mother and I have even done a neighborhood bible club for the kids of our area.  As kids started from kindergarten and then up to 6th grade I could see the development of their Christian knowledge and faith.  That is why I believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for my sins and the sins of everyone else.  He did that so that kids like those kids can grow up knowing the truth and sharing it with others.  For every belief starts somewhere and then it is shared.

I regret not letting my Dad know I had forgiven him for the past. I regret not telling my Mom thank you for becoming a beautiful strong independent woman for the sake of herself, my sister, and myself. I regret not telling them how sorry I was for putting them through hell during my selfish, yet rebellious teenage years. I feel I let my parents pass on with unresolved issues. I have learned that I need to make all amends and peace with loved who are getting ready to pass on before it is too late. Because I could not let my feelings out when I had the chance; I have concluded that now, and until the end of time, I will always have those paths that lead me to live my life with irreversible regrets. This I do Believe. 
I lost both of my parents to cancer; before their passing, they decided hospice was going to be the best choice. My sister and I were the caregivers for both parents until the end. Caring for my parents was a lot of work, especially when they became bed bound. I spent, as much time as I could with my parents and when I was alone with them to let them know the things I needed to say; my voice seemed numb and I felt lost. I guess I just did not want to accept the truth. I told my parents I loved them, I sat and held on to their hands, and finally had the courage to tell them it was ok to go. Granted, I told my Mom it was ok to go five minutes before she passed because I did not want to let go.
 I live with a tremendous empty feeling and it will never void. My irreversible regrets are a reminder of how cowardly I was; knowing it would be my last chance to say the things I needed to say. My parents brought me into this world and I let them go without letting them hear the things they deserved to hear, only because I did not want to face reality and realize they were going to pass away. I have learned when given the chance; make all amends and peace with loved who are getting ready to pass on before it is too late. I now will live by these words: do not hesitate to open my mind and free my thoughts, making my voice heard, without holding back a single word. At least I will know I will feel a sense of ease knowing I made my peace. I wish I could reroute my path and reverse my regrets, but I cannot and now I live with irreversible regrets, This I do Believe.

	All my life I've been called fat.  By my parents, my family, my friends, people from across the street.  Now, even though I'm a barely over average, average isn't good enough to most people.  I have a normal metabolism, which means if I eat an extra piece of cake, I will gain weight.  And I do eat extra cake. About five extra pieces of cake. 
Some people at my school think they'll lose weight if they eat miniscule amounts of things. A few people buy junk food and eat very little of it.  Like Oreos, Cheetos, beef jerky, and blueberry slushies.  Not to mention the potato chips they always get in the deli line at school.  It doesn't work.
Let's face it.  America is made up of junk food, obese people who live off of fast food restaurants and diet freaks who eat a sandwich and spend the rest of the day exercising to work off the calories.  Across the world in Africa, people are dying because of food related causes.  They wish for what we have.  What I have.  Indulgence.
	Every day at lunch, my friends say, ""Alexia, stop eating.  Isn't that your sixth piece of cake?""
	I smile at them.  Everyday, I eat the normal school lunch, like almost everybody else.  Sometimes I even eat breakfast twice.  Everyday, I gain a few pounds, and a few inches.  I walk around my school to burn it off every morning.  
But one day when I complained about it to one of my best friends, she said, ""Alexia, you're not fat.  You're big.  You're just taller, so consequently you weigh more.""
It made me re-think everything I had thought about myself.  Now I know that I am tall, not fat.  That self-confidence is what makes you want to take care of your body.  That if you like yourself, you will be more influenced to treat yourself right.  I like myself.  I treat myself right.
I'm not saying I'm a good example.  I eat pizza every Friday night and cake every day at school.  But my parents have taught me that you need to take everything in proportions.  That is how I'm going to do things from now on.  And now, after I'm finished with this, I'm going eat my lunch and a few extra pieces of cake, because I'm not worried about being overweight anymore.

My husband told me to take it anyway, but I followed my internal feeling and took a cab instead. On the way home, I saw that bus was in the ditch. Later that night I learned that only a few people survived. It seemed that someone above sent an angel to guard me throughout of those times.  There are many stories similar to mine, but one of them stands out to me. This is a story of my friend.
 	Chingiz a Muslim boy, who I knew from Kyrgyzstan, was a student at the university. His whole family was Muslim extremists, and they wanted him to follow their footsteps. If he ever betrayed their religion, he would be considered dead to his family.   He joined the Christian organization at his university, and his family found out about it. Then Chingiz became dead to his family, and he was kicked out of their house.
 	 A Christian organization rented an apartment for Chingiz on the third floor of the very old building. Stairways were extremely dark during the night due to the missing light bulbs.  One of the nights Chingiz was done with his classes and headed home up his dark stairway. Nothing happened that night, but what happened the next day changed his and his family's life forever. 
 Chingiz heard the knock on the door; it was one of his three brothers. He was in tears, and begged Chingiz for his forgiveness. Chingiz was shocked to hear that while he was going upstairs the day before, his brothers were hiding in the dark with the intention to kill him. Chingiz's parents couldn't live with the thought of their son being Christian, so they planned to kill him by sending his brothers to stab Chingiz to death.
Then Chingiz asked his brother, ""So why didn't you kill me then?""  His brother replied, ""If it wouldn't be for those two strong looking Russian guys who were with you, we would have killed you."" Chingiz said to his brother, ""I was alone. There was no one with me."" His conversation ended with tears and hugs. Chingiz and his brother knew at that moment who it was. His brother went back to tell their parents what have happened. Now all of Chingiz's family members are going to church with him, and now they believe in angels too.

I believe that he created flowers to brighten up the world and make the world smell good.  He created rainbows to give the sky something beautiful after a stormy day.  The stars are up in the sky to show us some of the most beautiful pictures if we just connect the dots. 
Everything was put on the earth to give us glimpse of heaven.
	I believe that the seven days of creation are important to our faith.  On the first day of creation, God created night and day.  To think if God didn't create a difference between nighttime and daytime what would happen?  If it was nighttime all the time, we wouldn't be able to grow any of our plants and it would be cold because we wouldn't have any of the suns rays to warm us.  But, if it were daytime all the time when would we rest?  When would the earth cool itself down?   It the sun shone all the time, it would be hot out and we might have to stay inside. So, I believe that God created day and night for a reason.
	The second day of creation God created the sky and the clouds.  Its good that we have clouds in the sky because they can produce rain, which helps the earth, and they can sometimes make cool shapes, but most of all it helps us protect us from the sun.  And what if there were clouds, but not sky to put them in?  That would be a little strange to bump into a cloud on the ground while walking or driving or to have them covering the windows of our houses.  Without the sky where would rainbows go and where would the birds fly? 
	On the third day of creation God created the land and plants.   There are many kinds of plants on the earth…trees, flowers, bushes, fruits, vegetables, and herbs.  We benefit from all of these in many ways.   Fruits, vegetables and herbs provide us food and sometimes are ingredients in medicine.  Trees produce fruits, provide us shade and give birds and other animal's protection.  In order for all these plants to grow they need fertile soil and ground, so God created the land to grow our food upon.  The ground also serves as a way of transportation, a place to build our homes and a place for the water to be stored.  
	The fourth, day God created the sun and the moon and the stars.  How amazing is it that God created so many beautiful things all on the same day?   He created the sun to warm the land, to help the plants grow and to keep us humans from freezing to death.  Then to make our world even better he gave the night sky the stars and the moon to light the earth, to allow the nocturnal animals to live and humans a time to rest.  The moon and the stars and so beautiful in the night sky and they allow scientist to study outer space and all that God made.  
	On the fifth day, God created the birds and the fish.  We had the stars in the night sky to give us something beautiful to look at and the birds to fill the daytime skies.  Birds also provide us with beautiful music as they sing.  Birds and fish both come in all shapes, sizes and colors and I believe that with out them in our oceans, trees and skies, our earth would be plain and boring. 
	On the sixth day, God created animals and human beings.   Without humans there would be no one to protect and utilize all of God's other wonderful creations.  The animals are needed on the earth to provide food for the humans and other animals.  Both animals and humans keep creating and help populate the world.  While not all humans take care of and protect the land, the majority of us are here to love and serve God and we appreciate and see the beauty in all that he has created. Where would we get our meet? 
	On the last day of creation God rested.  God created the seventh day for us to

064904.txt,Jacob,,Under 18,"St. Louis, Missouri","May 6, 2009",2009,You Gotta Have Faith,faith & religion,"My religion, Judaism, presents many challenges, but I enjoy meeting them and learning from them because it instills in me a sense of responsibility and connection to my tradition.  I learned about my religion while attending a Jewish day school and that experience helped to strengthen my commitment and beliefs.  I believe my religion has become a way of life and the life experiences it has offered me have strengthened my character and beliefs.  My religion has motivated me, contributed to my inner strength, and has been a source of pride.  
When I was in the eighth grade, I took a big step to becoming more committed and observant because I was learning from my rabbi about the significance of tradition.  Before becoming committed to my religion I did not really think about how important the things I do were, like what I eat or why prayer is necessary.  I have learned that these everyday events can bring meaning to my life and help me to be a better person.  When I went on my eighth grade trip to Israel, everything fell into place and I realized that keeping Kosher is a way of life.  I realized that being more observant has helped me be healthier and provided structure while elevating my spiritual level.  The difference I noticed is that I feel connected to my religion and I am a more respectful person.  
Another aspect that helped raise my level of being more respectful is the idea of repairing the world, Tikkun Olam.  I learned that charitable giving and acts of loving kindness is a responsibility in fixing the world.  I never really saw it as my ""job"" or responsibility as a kid to repair the world.  It was during my Bar Mitzvah preparation that I volunteered at a food pantry and with special needs children, these experiences helped me to see the significant impact it had on others and myself.  Ever since I saw how important it was to give food to the poor and needy, I have continued to work there periodically.  A famous teaching in the Torah, ""love your fellow as yourself,"" has an important metaphorical relationship to Tikkun Olam because if you were to hurt someone, you would be hurting the world and yourself.  My grandparents and parents have instilled in me the importance of doing good deeds and especially helping one in need of assistance because it will help make the world a better place.  This helped me realize my responsibility in working towards making a difference in the world.  Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel emphasizes the significance of Tikkun Olam through his quote, ""G-d is hiding in the world and our task is to let the Divine emerge from our deeds.""  I have learned that helping others by repairing the world demonstrates a respect for myself and for others.
Being more committed and observant has deepened my faith and helped me feel good about myself.  When I was younger, I was very shy, timid, and lacked self-confidence.  The more I learn about my religion and practice my faith, my confidence grows.  I have developed a stronger sense of identity and this has helped me to feel good about myself.  Pride and respect for my religion are important aspects of my life, which brings meaning and significance to it.  I believe that my religion provides structure, instills faith, and helps me create community connections, which in turn helps me be the best type of human being.  I feel that I am a better person and have helped the world be a better place because of the influence of my religion.  I believe religion guides me on the correct path to a good life.

064937.txt,Allison,,Under 18,"Magnolia, Arkansas","May 6, 2009",2009,Floating through Individualism,self-knowledge,"I believe in swimming against the current. When all the fish migrate one way, I dare to swim the opposite. Even though the current's tug is continuous, I swim as hard as my body will endure against it, opposite from the majority.  
Going against the grain, breaking out from the normal, and showing individualism all represent a certain personality. To be an individual, one has to show some sort of uniqueness, though it is not necessary to die one's hair purple or get multiple tattoos. However, in reality those spirited people are showing their individuality just as much as when I choose not to conform to the current fashion trend. Showing personality through hair and fashion is an example of swimming against the current.
Some may call it goofy, some may call it weird, some may call it extreme; but individuality in any form is not goofy, weird, or extreme. Being an individual improves self-confidence by learning to accept that others may find my or someone else's actions different. Being confident does not depend on a nose up in the air or a negative opinion of all others; instead, all self-confidence depends on is the self-assurance I alone provide myself. I choose to be the black and white fish in an aquarium full of purple and yellow striped fish, and one day all the other individuals of our world will wake up on the other side of the tank and decide to not let the other fish in the sea control them either. 
Imagine a timid girl at lunch at school choosing where to eat. The jaw-crunching piranhas, the nasty sharks, the calm koi, the friendly goldfish – all are examples of those with whom she might choose to enjoy a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The decision all depends on the individuality of the teen. Many people would choose the most socially accepted group even if it means rubbing gills next to the jaw-crunching piranhas. However, if it were me, the choice would be simple. I choose to surround myself with fins of fish I feel most comfortable around.  Many decisions, whether we realize it or not, depend on other people's opinions, but in reality a good decision-maker thinks of his or her preferences first and what others think later. The constant pull of the current may seem to be unending, but it is containable unlike the waves of the ocean.
I believe in swimming against the current. I believe in choosing to ride a different wave than all the other organisms in the ocean, even when that route may appear less conventional. When deciding which way to go, it does not matter where others are going; all that matters is where I am going.

In preparation for this monumental day, my mom had invested in every book ever written about parenthood. Her main discovery was the importance of a nutritious diet during childhood. For years she squeezed me fresh fruit juice each morning, loaded me with bananas, avocados and all those other ""brain foods"", and steered me clear of anything containing refined sugar. I was truly a product of the 'Infants and Toddlers' section of Barnes and Nobles. However, on my second birthday, my helicopter parents went out on a limb and decided to let me try a piece of my own birthday bake. As they prepared for an allergic reaction, I inhaled every piece of chocolate cake I could get my hands on, without a hint of hesitation or an upset stomach. My parents were speechless and mortified, but my dad's parents could only laugh. They had been secretly taking me to the ice cream store once a week for over a year.  This was just a small ""taste"" of the ways in which my grandparents would spoil me for the rest of my life. 
	As the first child, I was undeniably the guinea pig of the family. While this term carries a negative connotation, my experience as the tester child could not have been more positive. This is because my grandparents were always around to clean up the mess. 
	At sixteen I failed my driving test before I left the DMV parking lot. My parents completely lost faith in my ability to drive and were enraged at the amount of money ""wasted"" on professional driving lessons. My grandad decided to take matters into his own hands. He took me driving the following Sunday and every Sunday after that for two months. Although he forced me to drive painfully slow, I improved significantly and gained confidence in my driving skills. Then he signed me up for a second test. My grandad picked me up from school, drove me to the Ventura DMV, and daringly allowed me to use his car to take the exam. This time around I left the parking lot, and most importantly left the DMV with a drivers license. My grandad was so proud of me, and took no credit for my achievement. However, I knew that he was the person who had given me confidence and taught me how to drive, after my parents and driving instructor failed miserably. 
	My grandparents are the only people I know who have a solution to all of my problems. They are also the only people I know who would frame my second grade drawings, send me a birthday card three weeks in advance, and watch me like a hawk when my parents left town. And they are most definitely the only people I know that send me care packages from Ireland, buy me an orange every week at the farmers market, and manage to brag about me to the receptionist at their doctor's office. They have a role in my life no other person has come close to. They each have a unique wisdom and loving spirit I will never observe in another human being. There has not been a day since July 31st, 1989 that I have not felt their love, support, guidance, and prayers. I believe in the incomparability of grandparents.

Yes, I do believe in god, yes I believe in second chances and even third chances. I hope when I tell you that I got more than my share of second chances you will believe me. It all started before I was born my mom and my dad were waiting in the hospital room when the doctor came in and said that my mom was having me and when the doctor left my dad said that he didn't want me he wanted to have an abortion because, it was to soon to have a child but thankfully my mom stuck to her heart and said to my dad ""NO"" we are having the baby, so after I was born my dad left me and mom and went to the army. So that's the first time she saved my life, and I am very thankful for that.
	I thank god for a lot of things these days but only one thing sticks to my mind that I will never forget. When I was 5 years old my mom went in for my yearly checkup, everything was fine until the doctors noticed several things wrong with my kidneys and, my bladder started to act up. So the doctors said that I needed a surgery to find out what was wrong so, that's exactly what they did and they found out my kidneys weren't functioned a 100% one was working at 20% percent and the other was working at 80% the one working at 20% was almost failing I could die with that kidney if it ruptured during surgery. Then they took a look at my bladder to see why I was having bladder infections the doctor said that I needed a new bladder so they put a new bladder in an adult sized bladder and when they did those two surgery's I was back to normal. 
	I fell lucky to get second chances like those every once in a while its great to be alive and be able to run and play with your friends so if you have one of those days where you want to hurt yourself, stop and think to yourself wouldn't it be better to be alive then dead. I believe in god because it's the right thing, he's saved my life and he'll save yours to.

065358.txt,Todd,,18 - 30,"inverness, Illinois","May 12, 2009",2009,Goals and Dreams,self-determination,"I believe that dreams and goals can be achieved. I believe that anyone can set their mind to something and accomplish it. Our country began because a group of people had a dream and a goal of becoming something more than what they were. They desired freedom and liberty. After a long war and the persistence through had times, it was accomplished and our country was born. Throughout history, people have had dreams and goals for themselves or the groups they represent. One of the best examples of this is Jackie Robinson. Robinson was one of the best baseball players to ever step onto a field. The fact that he was one of the first black men in the league, playing during the 1940's and 50's, makes his accomplishments even more incredible. His dream was to be able to play professional baseball on the same field as white people. Even with thousands of racist fans taunting him, he kept his cool and was able to become the player that he is remembered as. Robinson kept his goals and dreams in sight and was able to overcome insurmountable odds and become a Major League Baseball Hall of Fame inductee. Robinson is one of the many examples. Throughout my own life I have had goals and dreams, whether it's a good grade or playing college baseball. I've been able to overcome troubles and difficulties and stay on the right path for success. I believe that everyone can accomplish their dreams with dedication, perseverance, and the right mind set.

065365.txt,Christine,,18 - 30,"Phoenix, Arizona","May 12, 2009",2009,This I Believe,self-knowledge,"I believe in athletics. The common argument is, ""Sports importance in high school is overrated."" However, those who work their entire lives to perform at a high level of competition understand what this special recognition means. Working to full potential for a goal is the most empowering feeling, not just athletes can relate to this. The difference between athletes and others is they put all of their sweat, tears and energy into obtaining their goal. Discipline, responsibility and teamwork are skills needed to succeed in life; these are also fundamental characteristics learned in athletics.
	I have now played tennis for thirteen years. It has developed into a love-hate relationship. Throughout the years, I have learned that no matter how much I hate the sport it is something I must persevere in. This discipline I have learned has translated into my everyday life and affected my determination to do well in both work and school. Many hours of practice and continuing workouts is draining, but because I believe in the cause of giving everything to obtain a goal, athletics is most important to me.
	Managing my school work, job and tennis practices has always been a challenge for me. At a young age, I had to mature to understand the importance of time management, effort and punctuality. This responsibility is a skill I will always be grateful for because it is necessary throughout life. When I am older, I know I can handle a lot of responsibility and will not question my ability to do so. Meeting the demands to playing a sport has taught me this accountability, which not many learn until later in life. 
	Tennis at the surface may seem like an individual sport, but when you look closer it is more than that. When I am playing a match, I am playing for my mom and dad, for my coaches, for my friends watching, not only to win but to leave everything I have on the court and walk off with a victory. When tournaments are team-based, we cheer each other on and must win for our friends. It is a selfless feeling, almost an out of body experience that pushes players to victory for the team. This teamwork is very important, not only does it help built friendships but it teaches cooperative skills. 
	Without sports, I would not be as mature as I am today. I have given a lot of sweat and tears to further myself in tennis. I have also learned many important life-lessons and skills from playing this sport. All athletes would agree that they would not be the same without their ambitions in athletics. It molds a person and matures many teens to be amazing people when they grow up. I believe in athletics.

065664.txt,Nathan,,18 - 30,"Columbia, Maryland","May 14, 2009",2009,Helping Everyday,good & evil;goodness & kindness;self-determination,"I believe in helping others every chance I get. I know this sounds like a cliché, but it is a belief I feel very strongly about and live my life by. This all started when I was a Boy Scout in middle school and our slogan was, ""Do a good turn daily"", so I decided to give it a try. At first I had to challenge myself just to find a small thing I could do each day to qualify as my good turn. Basically, I looked for a person who needed me to hold a door open each day. As I matured and was surrounded by older boys who followed the same slogan I began to really consider making an effort to finding a way to help others. Once I really got involved doing things to get a good turn each day I began to see how it really helped some people. 
One instance that I still can remember clearly was back when I was only 15. There had been an exceptionally large snow storm and when shoveling off my sidewalk (because my parents made me) I noticed my neighbor who lived two houses down had not cleared her sidewalk covered in a little less than a foot of snow. I decided that I would do my best to help her as I could, so once I finished my sidewalk I just moved on over to get hers too. What I did not know was that she lived alone and had a job during the day plus she worked as a nurse at night; making what seemed a simple task for me an unpleasant process for her. A few days later I found a card on my front steps from the same neighbor thanking me for clearing off her sidewalk without any prompting. The card went on to explain how she would never have had time to do a little task like that and it expressed her deepest gratitude. I did not realize how much of a difference just shoveling a sidewalk could make. This marks the point in my life where I decided to go out of my way to help others every day, with no exceptions, because what seems like an easy thing to me can make a world of difference for someone else.
I have helped somebody one way or another every day for over four years from that day now and it is the most gratifying things I can ever do. As a matter of fact, today I spent an hour revising and editing one of my friend's major papers for his English class. Sure, I could have been doing other things for myself, rather than this, but I have twenty three other hours today to do whatever I want so I have no problem helping my friend do the best he can in school.
I believe that everyone likes helping others, but it's just like getting yourself up early to go to the gym; It's hard to start but once you get into the groove of things you are glad you talked yourself into it.

065889.txt,Kathryn,,Under 18,"Easton, Connecticut","May 17, 2009",2009,The Power Within Me,self-knowledge,"I believe power is something that comes from within. For many years I did not realize I had always had power. I just didn't know how to find it. 
Until the first time I stepped onto a stage, I had no idea what the feeling of being in control was like. The moment I was reciting my lines to the audience, I felt a rush of adrenaline I had never felt before. I became a new confident person.
For the first time I felt a sense of power. I was in control of the audience, capturing their attention and toying with their emotions. Within each new character, I could rediscover myself and allow the audience to learn to love, hate and sympathize with my part. Being onstage allows my confidence to grow. And with that confidence comes my own power to love myself and be in control of my life. I alone can make the decisions for myself. I can choose to live a happy, or miserable life. And after each performance, I would take my bow feeling poised and proud of myself. 
Of course, I am not onstage every night. Most days my audience is not there. It became easy to loose the feeling of power I gain. Over the summer I developed Bulimia Nervosa to the point where I was hospitalized. Originally I thought I was in control of my behaviors. But like any addiction, the disease quickly became in charge. About a month before I was admitted to the clinic, it was opening night of a new show. The play was at a point where I was offstage. I was in the bathroom, giving into my eating disorder symptoms. I knew my cue would come any second and I knew that for the show it was vital that my character should enter onstage at the right moment. Yet I stayed there, alone and helpless. I missed my cue. It was only by a few seconds, but long enough for there to be an awkward pause onstage. I felt horrible and hated myself. But as I was playing my part onstage, I glanced out into the audience. They were all watching me. For a few moments I was free from the chains of my disease. I was reminded I was in control. I suddenly felt invincible. 
The next day, I told my parents. I chose to ask for help. The last couple months of recovery have been the most difficult months of my life. Sometimes it felt hopeless. But I have been able to overcome my disease, and now I make the decisions. Not my disorder. I am choosing to live my life in a smart and healthy way. I believe my performances brought out this power from within me. And with it, I can be in control with myself. I can choose to achieve greatness and to overcome the downs of life. All I have to do is just think back to opening night with my audience sitting before me. This, I believe.

065942.txt,Lori,,Under 18,"franklin, Tennessee","May 18, 2009",2009,This I Believe,self-determination;self-knowledge,"When I sat down at my computer and stared at the blank page and annoying flicker of that little line I was slightly discouraged. All of the example writings I read were about death, illness, and people overcoming things. And they were all beautifully written. Great writing always intimidates me, those people with the ability to create something so meaningful so creative. What could I, a sixteen year old, possibly write that would really matter? My life has been blessed and while yes I've had bad days where I've cried over a broken friendship or lost loved one, nothing truly tragic has fallen on me. I really haven't had time to create a philosophy on life, to know what I believe in. I mean sure, I believe in God, I believe in love, but none of these things felt true to write about. But then as I sat there with every word I typed I realized that this was part of my belief, the belief in creation.  We all want to do something in this world. Like, really do something. Elvis Presley once said ""Do something worth remembering."" I don't know anyone who wants to leave this life forgotten. Now, I'm not talking about fame, oh no. That's not the only way to impact this world, in fact sometimes the most famous people end up just being drifted logs in the river of time. There's so much more you can do in this world, you can create. For me, as I sat there writing and listening to music pounding through my blood, the drum synchronized with the beating of my heart, I was inspired by someone else's impact on the world, someone's creation. Creating something in this world is one of the most important accomplishments one can make. Creation has always been the hope in dark times. When something bad happens, I've found that creating something always helps. It's a reminder that I can still go on, I can still make something. The world can beat me down, but it can never rid me of my purpose. It can never rid me of my need to create. In a time of war and destruction, many people look towards creation. When the Spanish city of Guernica was bombed in 1937 Pablo Picasso looked at the tragedy and created a painting that is world famous and a constant reminder of the beauty that can come out of any situation. To me though, the real purpose behind this painting and anything else that is created is to remind us that when you are able to make something, you are able to go on. 
Historical references are always nice, but you can't really have a belief unless it means something personal to you. There have been times when I have felt like the entire world was falling apart around me and I would grab some paper and just put something down on it. Seeing those words, reminded me of stability and that after all of it they would remain. My grandmother has dementia, and watching her forget things, fearing that she will forget me, I am reminded of how important it is to leave something in this world that will always be remembered. Everything around us has been created, is the result of someone dreaming somewhere and I believe that one day my creations will find a place among these.

066141.txt,Kathryn,,Under 18,"Joliet, Illinois","May 21, 2009",2009,Life After Death,afterlife,"My grandmother died a little over a year ago this month. I found out she was dying when my mother called me. I was going to a band competition several hours away. She died that night. I really regret not getting to say a proper goodbye. It was really emotional for me because I'd never known anyone that died who was close to me until then. I started imagining all the things she was looking forward to that she'd miss. My eighth grade graduation, my high school experience, my marching band performances, and countless other activities. All along my mother kept telling me, ""It's okay. She's in a better place now with no more pain or disabled-body to stop her from doing what she wants. She's with loved ones now. It's okay."" That was when I realized there had to be something after life ends.
 I believe in the afterlife. I believe there is something after life. There can't be nothing. Where do all the souls go of the people that die everyday? They have to go somewhere. Everyone's going there someday, but no one knows what's there; although, everyone knows how to get there: through death.
 You may believe in supposed ""Heaven"" or ""Hell"" but I'm not so sure. In the Catholic religion it says God loves all His children so why would there be a ""Hell"" for those He hates if He loves us all? Who decides which one any of us should go to? Who decides which people should die today? These are some of the questions I ask myself everyday, but very few answers are able to be given. How do I know there aren't the ghosts or souls or spirits of my friends, and family around me everyday?
 The answer is: I don't know.
 I won't know until it's my turn to die and move on to where ever it is I'm supposed to go. It's the same for the rest of the human population. The basic philosophy of, ""What I don't know, I'm afraid of"", is very simple but a lot of power is packed into those seven words: Fear.
 It's such a big part of life; the thrill of death. The rush of adrenaline as life ends. The unbearable excitement and fear as it wells up inside you as your soul leaves its body, going to join either ""Heaven"" or ""Hell"" or where ever it is one goes in the afterlife as your heart beats its last beat in this world.
 I believe there is something after life, but I don't have a clue as to what it is. I don't know why it's there, how it got there, or even what is there, but I'm positive there's something after death. I believe in the afterlife.

The sheer passion, unity, and hypnotizing spell instilled on the world give this game its character. This is the world's sport for a reason and serves a plethora of purposes for people around the world.
I was introduced to football as soon as I could stand on two legs and it has stuck by my side ever since. As people come and go in life, football is the one constant. I grew up as a shy child and friends were scarce to me. Football was always there to play with me and fill that void space in my life.
 I did have two good friends though, a cousin and a neighbor. I spent ten years of my life with them bonding like any other group of friends. As high school approached, we all changed.  They both went on the wrong path and I had to let them go. I loved school and aspired to become a doctor, they wanted to fit in and soon drugs replaced me. 
I was completely alone, yet football never left. My passion for the beautiful game has only grown more intense each year, as I've gotten to know it. The history, culture, and secrets have revealed themselves to me as our friendship has cured.
 Football evolved to be my refuge from the daily stresses of being a teen. Everyone has experienced them, and football was there to relieve me from them. Without it, I was sure to explode. The late nights without sleep and only calculus, the early morning chemistry study, and the lunch time touch up session for essays pounded me mentally into a pulp. Yet each year of high school, I had football to send me to my world away from our earth and its reality. Whether it be on the tennis court, concrete driveway, short grasses of our Elk Grove stadium, or the inside of a gym, a football ball and my feet were the only necessities.
 Football has introduced people to its best friends, kept people from cracking, and given the poor a new start. It is the world's game. It united the Ivory Coast in its civil war during the world cup and kept me from feeling alone and helpless. I believe football is man's best friend.

Most groan at the thought, but it's unavoidable. I believe that all experiences in life, big or small, are learning experiences that change you and make you who you are. They might not all be fun or exciting but all of them are important.
        A couple of years ago my brother and I went out to play some soccer. I sat down to tie my shoe and had put the soccer ball down in front of the door. BIG MISTAKE.
        Running outside,my brother tripped over the ball. When he fell he went down face first, his nose, knees, and elbows were all really bloody. As quick as lighting, he burst out crying. I was nine, and as scared as a toddler lost in a haunted house. I didn't really want to tell because I thought I would get in trouble, but I decided right then, he was more important. When they sorted everything out, they told me that they were proud of me for doing the right thing.
        From this I learned that honesty really is the best policy. Because I was honest, everything turned out alright. I will always look back and remember how it good it felt to be truthful. This experience helped me to do the right thing on numerous other occasions; it changed me into being a more honest person. Little experiences like that are not always remembered, but they still change you, even if you don't know it.
        Another experience that I had that was a little more exciting was 9/11. We were visiting New York and my uncle taking us to see the Twin Towers. 
        ""Look Artika the clouds are pink!"" My mom said
        ""Wow! They're pretty."" I replied.
        My uncle tuned the radio on. Little did I know, by turning the radio on, we would find out why those clouds were pink. By tuning the radio on, we found out that the towers were falling.
       Inside the car, my mom and my uncle were getting really scared. The radio said that the bridges were being closed, and everybody had to evacuate. People who didn't leave fast enough would have to walk home.
        After the experience, I learned to value life a little more. Although it was really scary, now I'm always thankful to be safe when I hear of floods, tsunamis, and people dying on the news. It made me think about life in a different way; it opened my eyes to how short it is, and how it could end just like that.
        A lot of things happen in your life. Big or small all experiences in life are important. Some seem feel like a really big deal right now and later they won't, others feel like they aren't such a big deal and really, they are.  The point is, everyday there are important experiences that you go through; every experience big or small is a learning experience that changes you in some way. This I believe.

066892.txt,David,,18 - 30,"Westlake, Ohio","May 29, 2009",2009,Laughter,humor & laughter,"I believe that laughter is the most powerful medicine of all. Nothing can raise one's spirits better than a good dose of humor. 
One story in particular that I never forget accurately depicts the true power of laughter. A man, after learning that his cancer was incurable and he only had a few weeks to live, decided to leave the hospital and stay in a nearby hotel to hopefully extract as much joy as possible out of his final days on Earth. He watched as many comedy programs, movies, and concerts as he could, using laughter and humor to mask the pain that he was enduring. As weeks passed, doctors saw improvement to his condition, and he lived significantly longer than expected. I firmly believe that this should be attributed to his cavalier state of mind. There is no limit to how beneficial a positive state of mind and a sense of humor can do for someone. 
Time is our greatest enemy. The best moments are usually not even discovered as great until they have already passed. We look back at the past only to wish we could have enjoyed ourselves more. Laughter is the only thing that I have found to slow down time. It allows people to live more in the moment, capturing completely uninterrupted joy for an instant, but the joy can also remain gratifying even long after the laughter is over, like a dove taking off out of someone's hands. 
Laughter also has the ability to bring people together. There is nothing more unifying then sharing a good laugh with someone. During a difficult time, the ability to laugh, no matter how impossible and out of place it can seem, is the ultimate relief. 
Laughter is also an extremely powerful emotion. It can suppress some of the worst feelings of guilt, sadness, and regret. Regret is always something that I have struggled with, likely because I put difficult and often times unreasonable demands on myself to succeed. I frequently remember the mistakes I regret as oppose to the success I have had. One thing that I know I will always be able to rely on is laughter. Laughter's healing powers could come from its ability to put things into perspective. Constantly maintaining an accurately relative perspective of the world is an essential to happiness, and most easily obtained through laughter. 
Life can be very fickle for many different reasons. Whether it is because of a string of bad luck or a lack of opportunities, it can seem difficult to consider life to be fair. The best way to make life fair is to enjoy, laugh, love, and smile as much as possible. 
Only good things can come from laughter.

The school year was about halfway done meaning groups and cliques were already formed. I arrived at the classroom and was asked to sit. I was then introduced to my fellow classmates; I was extremely excited. As the first week passed, I noticed my English was improving. I wasn't really focusing really on having friends but on improving my English and learning the material. In the second week of school, I became extremely traumatized. A classmate said to me ""What are you doing here? You don't know English."" I didn't really understand what he said, so I laughed because everyone else was laughing. One of the classmates that were laughing translated it and told me what it meant; I stopped laughing, for I thought that even though I wasn't as fluent as they were, I was getting better. The classmates continued saying such things and the same girl continued to translate them. I was becoming tired and wasn't really caring anymore until one of them said, ""You came to my country, so the least you can do is learn the language; you dumb immigrant."" This comment, one which I would easily ignore today, bothered me a great deal. I didn't go to school for two weeks because of this. I simply laid in my bed pondering about the issue; sometimes I would cry when I remembered the immigrant line. I knew that I was an immigrant and that I didn't know English and I were in America. Therefore, he was entirely correct; these classmates made me feel very angry, sad, and confused at the same time. My classmates had verbally abused me; this verbal abuse had a straight link with my feelings which made the pain greater. I also became extremely confused at the fact that I did not understand how someone's comments can make me feel so small and worthless. My parents and I asked me if I wanted to transfer out and go to a different school; I quickly said yes. On the same day in which I had the conversation with my parents, the school called wondering if I was okay. Aside from the school, all of my classmates got together and called me to apologize. After an extremely long conversation, my classmates had learned that our differences are what make us unique while I, on the other hand, learned that words can hurt far more than physical pain. I ended up returning to the school and getting along with my classmates who were now considered friends. This particular experience helped me understand that hurting someone with your words can be much more painful and dangerous.

067923.txt,Erica,,18 - 30,"Greenville, North Carolina","June 13, 2009",2009,You Can't Do it Alone…,faith & religion;family;love;setbacks,"I believe in family.  Family means far more than the six letters that make up the word.  Strength, support, comfort, and love are a few words that I consider synonyms for the precious word.  The members of my family are my biggest fans, support system, my coach, my mentor through the struggles, and most importantly my role models.  Two years ago my family faced a troubling time.  From a broken back and a broken hand, to incarceration and death, we faced it all.  
  I believe in working to make a family function.  I do not have the perfect family life.  Two years ago my uncle was placed in prison, where he remains today on drug charges.  Since the remainder of his family is deceased, and we are all he has left, we are working to make things right in his life and ours.  We fight, we argue, and we even disagree with my uncle at times, but I have been taught that maintaining families takes work and families should stick together.  I believe that God will show my uncle the right way.
   I know I have learned from my family.  During that same year my uncle was first incarcerated, my sister broke her back and was in the hospital on bed rest for a week.  Doctors feared paralysis and as she lay in bed drugged with enough medicine to keep her still, we all realized her fate was in God's hands.  Not knowing the outcome of this horrific accident was the hardest part.  My family was at the hospital constantly and so were our friends that we consider our own ""family.""  This incident has shown me that we need our friends, and our friends become our family.  I believe in an extended family.
    Now that I am nearing the end of my collegiate career and am looking to settle down soon and start a family of my own I value my family even more.  Looking back to what I refer to as the ""awful"" year, I realize it was a blessing in disguise.  The ""awful"" year taught me about strength in numbers.  There was no way anyone would have made it through that year alone.  With the help of my family, I believe we got through it together.  I want to model my own family after the one that has shown me so much strength and support; the one that has been so comforting to me throughout my childhood and the one that will always be there when needed.  I want to be a strong woman like my mother, able to govern.  I want to posses the skills my dad has and be the backbone that holds our family together.   I believe in the power of a family.
 I believe in imperfections.   We are taught that nothing is perfect, and no one should ever be expected to be perfect, alone.  But with the love of a family, the support of an extended family, and through faith in God, one puts themselves on the path towards greatness.  Although nothing is forever, the love of my family will be instilled within me until the day I die.  I hope to pass this feeling to my own children and show them the same love and support I have been blessed with thus far.  I believe in family.

067952.txt,Natalie,,Under 18,"Santa Monica, California","June 15, 2009",2009,Game Night,family,"I believe in game night. Poker, Beuda, Gin, Spoons, Egyptian War, Scrabble, Monopoly, and whatever other games my family has in the closet. Every once in a while my whole family sits down at the table to play cards, board games, to laugh, to talk. Seven people live in our house, including myself. There are my parents and my siblings: Gabriel, Wendy, Eddie, and Adrian. With that many of us living in an apartment, it is constantly hectic which means that we don't get a lot of family fun time. Either someone has to work or needs to go to school or has practice. Whatever it is, there is almost always someone who is not at home. We used to eat dinner together every day and talk about what goes on in our lives, but that doesn't happen anymore. That's why our game nights are so important. To me, the time we spend together is priceless. So whenever it happens, it just makes my day. 
I remember one time when my godparents, or ninos, came from Mexico and we had a game night. They were included. That was the best game night ever. That night we even threw in La Loterίa Mexicana. I remember feeling bad for our neighbors because I was sure that they could hear us laughing and yelling at two o'clock in the morning. The one bad thing that I could remember was that my brother got angry when he lost-he tends to be a sore loser. He always throws the worst tantrums and my dad always has to tell him ""No te enojes. Solo es un juego"". This always happens, and it always ruins game night because as soon as one person is mad, everyone else gets annoyed. I was starting to put everything back in the closet but then my nina asked me why I was putting all of the games away. I told her that we can't play anymore because Eddie's mad and he ruined everything. Then she told me ""¿Y por qué vas a dejar que arruine todo? Nunca debes dejar que una piedrita te tumbe. Siempre van a ver obstáculos, cosas que no te permiten ser feliz, pero tienes que encontrar la forma para ignorar las y ser feliz de toda manera. Vamos a jugar."" Basically she said that there is always something that tries to get in the way of your happiness, but you shouldn't let it affect you. And she's right. Thanks to her, I no longer let little things get in the way of me being happy. I move on and forget about them. That's what I should have done a long time ago. A tiny pebble isn't going to be able to knock me down anymore. This I believe.

068045.txt,Seun,,18 - 30,"Huntsville, Alabama","June 16, 2009",2009,The Joke,self-knowledge;setbacks,"Suffering has a humor all its own, an inescapable irony in the contrast between what we expect and what we so often get. I learned to appreciate this at the 2004 Nigerian Olympic trials. I was ranked third in the championship heat of the men's 50 meter freestyle. Excitement built in my chest as I channeled through the pool as fast as my arms and legs would churn. After 16 years of training, I was going to smash the record, win a medal, and qualify for the Olympics – all in one swoop! Then I was blinking up at the scoreboard. Last? Dead last. Despite myself, I had to laugh.
In hindsight, that dramatic reversal of expectations was liberating. Suffering is like a joke that gets funnier with each retelling, but the punch line is always the same: pay attention. When we shelve our plans and simply enjoy the moment –  whatever it brings – we can laugh even through our tears. Four days ago, at age 26, I was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and anemia.  My world collapsed, and yet I've never been more grateful.

068190.txt,Mary,,,"Laurel, Maryland","June 19, 2009",2009,Dear Washington Post,,"""Don't be so impressed. It's not that big a deal,"" said Ben Bradlee, to Ranjit Arab, the University Press of Kansas's publicity manager, when he told the famous former executive editor of The Washington Post that it was an honor to meet him in a chance meeting during a publicity call.
Having just decided to take the buyout offer the Post had offered me after 27 years of working at the Post in Circulation, Editorial, Legal, and the Newsroom, and realizing it was probably the last time I would ever see Ranjit, I'd offered to take him on a mini-tour. He's a big fan of Pulitzer Prize-winning National reporter Dana Priest, so we were disappointed to find out she wasn't in that day. I told Ranjit she is one of the nicest, most down to earth journalists I've ever met. But meeting Ben Bradlee more than made up for not seeing Dana.
Ranjit and I talked about how sad it was that the newspaper and book industries were struggling. Though the Washington Post, according to its Website hit counts, is being read by more people than ever, circulation figures and advertising revenue have dropped since the advent of the Internet.
When we got to the lobby, Ranjit wished me the best of luck and I teared up. He gave me a hug.
I've never been one to cry in public but every time someone brings up the buyout I start weeping like Tammy Faye Bakker. I ran into a younger co-worker, Dani Seiss, in the ladies room and she said, You have a look on your face, is something wrong? I'm taking the buyout, I said, and started crying. She put her arms around me and said, Look at it as an opportunity. I nodded and cried more. I wish someone would offer me a buyout, she joked.
Why are you crying? my husband says. You should be happy. They're giving you full retirement eight years early, and more.
Bill Aiken, a Buddhist friend, said, don't take it personally. I feel like I'm dying.
The first time I got a buyout offer I never even opened the packet. Last year when I got my second buyout offer, my boss, Marie Arana, inquired on my behalf about the chances of my getting laid off. No promises, but not likely, she reported back. This time, my new boss, Rachel Hartigan Shea, asked her new boss, Raju Narisetti, what she should tell her people, and in my case he said, 27 years? She should seriously consider it.
Richard Harrington, who took the last buyout and looks better than ever and is working on a book about controversial album covers, met me for coffee and said, You're going to love it. I think it's the loss of identity, I said. He said it was different not being Richard Harrington of The Washington Post anymore, but being just Richard Harrington is just fine. I said, but you've got this large legacy of music coverage out there forever. I was just a fly on the wall. But I LIKED being a fly on the wall. You'll be a bigger fly on a different wall, he said.
I told Beth Broadwater, Book World's former art director, because the stand alone Book World died last February and reviews were rerouted to the Outlook and Style sections, I think I just thought I would be here until I died at my desk one day with a smile on my face.
I've loved working for The Washington Post. It's an institution I believe in, and I had my second daughter while here and a knee replacement, and was fortunate to have supportive bosses when I got sick or my daughters needed me.
I got to meet Maya Angelou and play peekaboo with Chinua Achebe's pre-school grandson.  I got to shake hands with Mikhail Gorbachev and president-elect Barack Obama.  I even got a few bylines.
But best of all, I got to be an eye-witness to world class excellence in journalism in action.
The Post isn't perfect–I didn't like how it did things sometimes–but no institution made up of human beings can be. But trying to live up to its ideals makes the Post as good as it can be, day after day. The Washington Post stands for getting it right and it's a source of pride for virtually all the employees, journalists or not.
In 1982, when I was hired as a secretary in the Circulation Department, there were lavish Christmas parties and picnics for the distributors, and Newsroom bashes were the stuff of lore. Almost all parties are the stuff of lore now, and some Circulation, Advertising and IT functions have been outsourced.
Newsroom culture has changed dramatically, too, and is changing even faster every day with restructuring and 300 washingtonpost.com employees moving from Arlington to be under the same roof as the print side, the integration creating a new base for creating and distributing news beyond print and computers.
I don't know if it ever happened but I could always imagine Ben Bradlee or Len Downie picking up a phone and roaring, Stop The Presses! But I can only imagine Marcus Brauchli, our new executive editor, taking out his Blackberry and sending a text message.
An exciting new media age has arrived and I would love to see what happens next, but thank you, Warren Buffett, for the wise counsel that allowed the Post to offer generous early retirement benefits that let some of us to leave with some money instead of a sorry or a pink slip, as has happened at other newspapers.
Don Graham, thank you for always making me feel like my hard work and dedication to something I believed in mattered. Katharine Weymouth and Marcus Brauchli, thank you for taking the Post into the future with so much energy and determination and journalistic integrity. I'm rooting for you.
To my soon to be ex-Post Guild-covered colleagues – join the Guild. It's there to protect you.
In a farewell message to the newsroom, Lynn Duke, who took the last buyout,  remembered a Rwandan postal worker hiding in the bush with his family who told her of many bodies in the nearby hills, and asked her to 'Tell people that we need help.' ""Telling of peoples' struggles – and living up to their faith – has shaped my journalistic life…I will forever be grateful to The Washington Post for the privilege of being this kind of journalist at this great newspaper.""
A hundred-plus farewell cakes later, that pride in being even a small part of a great journalistic tradition continues to echo with sincerity again and again. The Post tries to get it right and we don't–and shouldn't–take that for granted.
That's why meeting you meant something, Mr. Bradlee. You and Mrs. Graham and your successors stand for a tradition of conscientious journalism crucial to a healthy democracy.

068385.txt,Kiyana ,,Under 18,"Lapwai, Idaho","July 10, 2009",2009,definition of love,,"Love, what is love? what does it mean? if you look the wotd love up do you know what you get? the dictionary deffinition of love is a profoundly tender, passionate affection for another person. i believe love is more than what we see. i think love is thrown around to often. The word has more power than most things in life. i am young but i believe that i have found that love. i think everyone has only one true love. Because you cannot truly feel the exact same way for one as you do another.
i think love is in everything i believe love is for eveyry and anyone. if it is a high school sweet heart, husband, Ex, friend. doesnt matter it is always there wherever you look there is always someone who truly loves/ cares about you and has your heart. love is pure love is untouched.
although i am youngand me and my significant other have been together for about 9 months i believe that love is present in everything we do and say to eachother. we have both found something about eachother that we really like. and at this age i think it is really rare for young adults to stay loyal and have a ""relationship"" because you meet plenty of new people and you make tons of new friends that might be hard for some people.
for us it is different we have a special bond. We cannot be pulled appart.love isnt perfect if it was i dont think it would be love. you need to be tested and brought outside of your comfort zone, love is very rough around the edges. but once you get twords the middle it gets smooth, you may run into a coulpe cracks in the road but it will be patched up at the end.
we have had our ups and downs and our bumps in the road. we have made sacrifices. we are diciplined. love is like a pop quiz you never know what is going to come at you you never know what to expect. love will knock you down when your not looking, if you blink for just a second it could hurt you. not physically but mentally and emotionally. i turned my back on love for not even a minute and it almost ended. love is a sacrid bond that cannot be broken love is well yeah corny but love is a battlefield. i believe that love is life and life is living. so if you dont love then your not living at all.

068478.txt,Mark,,,"Mechanicsville, Virginia","July 20, 2009",2009,Visiting Nursing Homes,charity & service,"I believe in visiting nursing homes.  One indelible childhood memory that clings near to my heart is of Christmastime outings to a local nursing home.  I can't say I enjoyed these visits.  The unpleasant smells and hot rooms made me uncomfortable, but my parents made me go along with twenty other kids from my church.   We were the holiday entertainment to a group of men and women who looked as old as God.  We passed out hand crafted greeting cards and candy canes.  We sang carols like ""The First Noel"" and though we were off key, their broad smiles told me that Christmas morning arrived early.  
This memory has captured my heart because I am in the process of moving my grandfather into an elder care facility.  I have a growing sense of grief knowing that this will be Granddaddy's last move.  Questions are running through my mind, though they are not so much about his physical health.  What I am anxious about is whether or not my grandfather will be emotionally okay because, at the age of 96, he has outlived all of his siblings, his spouse, and his only child.  This is an awfully isolating experience and so I wonder what an ever-shrinking circle of friends does to a person like my grandfather and I wonder if children still make Christmastime visits to nursing homes.  I hope so because the gift of presence and friendship, even from complete strangers, has the power to shatter the cold walls of loneliness.  I believe every person deserves the life-giving blessing of friendship despite their age or circumstance.
Caring for senior adults is a part of my vocation.  It is a significant role I have as a pastor, and yet, it is personally important to me because I see in my grandfather the devastating power of loneliness. Old age and declining health are partners in crime; they steal memories and rob many people of independence.  The victims are punished to a life of solitary confinement, but life need not be this way.  Lives void of friends is unnatural and unnecessary.  The old need not be alone.  
I am glad my parents made me go to nursing homes because the smells and the wrinkles introduced me to a new way of understanding friendship.  Friends need not look, talk, act, or smell just like me; they only need to share their lives.  Singing a Christmas carol or sacrificing personal time to visit the elderly is not only an opportunity to share the gift of friendship, it's also a chance to receive a precious gift from God.  Good friends offer each other support, companionship, and a heart-warming presence, which deepens life with laughter, tears, and life-giving connection.  I believe in friendship because I believe the young and old can be life-giving partners in this journey we have together on earth.

068489.txt,Hkawn,,,"Jacksonville, Florida","July 20, 2009",2009,My Dream,work,"Dreams? When people talk about their dreams, they talk about becoming somebody who is famous, rich, and an influencer. Some people like to be remembered for generations as a person who has done a good cause for the society we live in. Others have dreams of  inventing something which has never been existed before. For myself, my dream is becoming an Architect. From my childhood memory, I still remember that there were times I said to myself that one day I would try to become a person who could make a difference to the houses and buildings we live in for better. My desire remains the same and it will never changed in the future.
Looking back my performance of the past, I recognize that I am feeling a sense of achievement despite the fact that is not as much as I would like to achieve. In terms of achievements, I have never failed to accomplish what I am required to do at college. I have always been able to complete my coursework, attend classes regularly and pass exams. However, I feel that I could have done better. I believe that one always should look to perform better today than yesterday.
In terms of challenges I am facing, I have some other commitments, such as my job as well as social network activities at church beside my college life. Therefore, sometimes I find that it is not too easy to be able to manage my time effectively, but I can't see these obstacles as excuses for delaying or weakening me reaching my future goal. As they say, nothing is impossible. If there is a will, there is always a solution. I feel that the only thing that can prevent me from making my dream comes into in a reality is me. Therefore, I must believe in myself, and I must believe in my dream. I would never give up on my dream and myself. 
I believe that, to turn my big dream into a reality, it would be sensible to have plans of what I would like to achieve on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. I set myself a short term as well as long term goals. For the short term goals, I would complete this term at a good grade. Afterwards, try to perform better during the next semester. Then, the same process would be repeated until I reach my long term goal which is to get the Associate in Arts degree from the Florida State College by 2010, giving me an opportunity to study at the University of Florida to get Bachelors Degree what I had always dreamt of.
In order to reach my goals, I would start spending at least two hours on my study on a daily basis starting now. I will read as many magazines as possible and at least a couple of books a month relating to my subject area so that I would gain more knowledge and I would be better prepared for my future studies. I am a person who believes in hard work and commitments. Without these vital ingredients, dreams would be just dreams. What I do know for certain is that I am on my way to reaching my dream. As long as I keep performing constantly as before, and start taking actions mentioned above, I can't see any reason why I can't make my dream into a reality.

068542.txt,Brittany,,,"Ontario, California","July 22, 2009",2009,The Hazelnut of Life,,"In the morning I yearned for something new and different, not just the same old bagel with cream cheese. One bright morning I awoke with a new possibility—some variety for my usual bagel.  I was invited to climb aboard the 777 plane on a trip to Italy. At nineteen, I felt the world open up to me. Ticket in hand, I skipped toward Terminal D. I was introduced to something I never tasted before. I always knew I wanted to travel, but I never imagined I would have such a craving for it. 
I arrived in Italy with history staring me in the face. I staggered about the ancient streets of Rome, trying to decipher the Italian street signs. I lingered next to a pastry shop, my nose almost lifting me from the ground as I got a whiff of crepes with… chocolate? It looked like chocolate, but it spread like peanut butter. My uncle could see the light in my eyes. ""Brittany, you should try some Nutella, I bet you'd really like it."" 
My eyes grew wider as I bit into the Nutella-filled crepe. Warm chocolate and hazelnut nearly seared my tongue. I did not wait to swallow; I took another bite and savored the chocolate this time.  Nutella became the highlight of eating in Italy. I could not get enough of the creamy, chocolate and hazelnut spread. I finished the last bite, licking my fingers clean afterwards. My stomach growled for more.
Over the next few days, I inhaled and the wind splashed my face as I wandered the hills of Tuscany. I let my eyelids fall shut as I listened to the water canals of Venice. I craned my neck and, with squinting eyes, peered into the vast distance of the Mediterranean Sea.  My life was no longer limited to seeing Michelangelo's ""David"" in history books. I no longer had to guess what the Sistine Chapel felt like; nor piece together the blocks of the coliseum. A new flavor of life left me dreaming for more before sunrise.
I eagerly soaked in the every bit of new discoveries. I learned that Nutella goes with everything. I enjoyed spreading it on toast, rolls, bagels, biscuits, pancakes—wherever spreading is possible. In Italy they made it into gelatos, layered it on crepes, and stuffed it into pastries. The uses seemed never ending. Nutella was waiting and I never knew until I had the chance to discover it. History that even my great grandfather studied in school was waiting to be discovered, but I never thought it would taste so sweet.
Nutella became the symbol of my love for new experiences; I find joy in every bite. It is the gravy on my potatoes, the ketchup on my french fries, the hot caramel on my ice cream. I crave it. I wake up and the possibilities seem endless.
I believe in Nutella.

068587.txt,Mariam,,Under 18,"Nashville, Tennessee","July 24, 2009",2009,Love,love,"I believe that love cannot be explained in words. It is a great feeling that can be seen between any two people, but never explained. Many people misunderstand the real meaning of love. To put it all in a nutshell, God is Love. So, if one has God in his/her heart, then he will love everyone. There are three kinds of love: Aros (sexual love), Phileo (brotherly love), and Agape (loving everyone). The Bible clearly explains the true meaning of each type of love, but I will explain the view of each in today's society.
As I recall, Aros love is the type of love that is well known by all people. This type of love is being abused and misunderstood the most. I believe that the feelings for this love should be only between two united couples. Love is never wrong when God is in its mist. At a point in life, everyone will get the chance to experience this type of love because it is one of the sacraments. 
Phileo love, on the other hand, is mostly known by teens. I believe that this is the best kind of love ever. This is the type of love one should look for when looking for protection and safety. It is very easy to tell someone that you love them, but is a lot different when feeling the love. An only child in a family lives all his/her life searching for this type of love. 
Finally, there is the Agape love. This type of love is different from the other two. I believe that this is the type of love that is felt from the deeds of people around you. For example, this could be explained as the giving love. The more the people give out of love, the more the world will be peaceful. If not mistaken, I believe that this is the love meant when someone says I love you after doing them a favor. 
Nevertheless, love is always present, but can be felt in different ways. The meaning of love can differ from one person to another, but the most important thing is to have love in anything you say or do. As I said before, love can never be explained, even in countless words, but your action can say it all.

Even today, Asavari's wordless smile evokes in me a spontaneous joy, and in her searching gaze I find myself looking not at her but at the person I am inside. 
When humans seek incontrovertible evidence of a higher power, why look to God, rather than respect the capacity of an individual to elevate the human condition.  Even when faced with the prospect of not living past her teen years, Asavari embraced life to its fullest.  Amidst Asavari's unmistakable celebration of life, who was I to dwell on what might come afterward? 
This amazing young person is no longer with us physically, but she continues to inspire my life.  Asavari did not ask to be born with cerebral palsy.  My experience with Asavari was the highlight of the eight summers my high school students and I shared with her at a memorable camp in Northern New England, a place where campers of all ages transcended any perceived limitations to focus on their liberation. 
Her effervescent smile made me feel honored to turn my head to meet her eyes, looking beyond neck muscles that did not support her head, knowing I was in the presence of personal magic.  Despite evidence of a deteriorating body, Asavari possessed her own time warp which called forth a resurgent youthful spirit, one which she imparted to every person she met – one within me which I have yet to relinquish.  
To be with Asavari required a paradigm shift:  while to me or you, the wheelchair's mobilized musculature would be a limitation, to her it represented freedom.   She rode horses and skied mountains.  Her playful expression invited one to let go of inhibition, to see the possibility and wonder in life, even when constantly reminded of its paradox. 
Through her soundless laughter, she taught the humility to see life, not as an anticipated path but as an ongoing exploration, full of the mystery and excitement of tackling that which is not known.  
Her lessons were not spoken, nor written; nonetheless Asavari's gift for communication of the spirit brought over one hundred young and old to a memorial in central Maine, where we each shared remembrances of a special 15-year old. She also had the capacity to inspire as no one I have known.  Though my life is guided more spiritually than through any religious persuasion, Asavari's spirit moved me to leave behind my ego, to not only attend her service but to declare my love for life by reading an original poem which her journey has inspired in me. 
I believe in placing my efforts where I know they will make a difference, having learned from Asavari to not dwell on that which is out of my ability to influence.  Ultimately, I believe in the power of a child to unveil and demystify the human condition, releasing us from the alienation of our adult lives, thereby allowing us to experience true oneness in an embrace with our own humanity.
NOTE:  The camp is not mentioned by name and the camper's names have been changed at the camp and family's request for privacy.  ""Asavari"" is a sanskit name meaning:  ""spirit of the heavens.""

068990.txt,Caitlyn ,,Under 18,"Edmond, Oklahoma","August 26, 2009",2009,Kids Are Hard Work,children;Christianity;parenthood,"I believe that everyone should wait until they are married to have sex. Yes I am a Christian but another reason I believe in this is because the rate of teen pregnancy is increasing rapidly and very few people that age can care for a child.  Caring for a baby is a huge responsibility and one that I'm just not ready for.  
I have a job at Faith Christian Learning Academy, which is a daycare.  I care for the one year olds and I have a pretty good idea about how difficult being a teen mother would be.  The children cry randomly for no good reason, can't speak to tell you what they want, and get into everything.  Watching them is definitely a full time job and if I take my eyes off of them for even a second they could get into something I wouldn't want them to.  This job is increasingly difficult when one kid is sick and will just cry the whole time because he doesn't feel good or maybe one of them didn't get enough sleep at nap time and is just cranky. Also sometimes one of the babies will just want to be held the entire time, and trust me they start to get very heavy after an hour or so. I love kids but I still find this very challenging and for someone that doesn't love children as much as I do would find this job nearly impossible. I only work there for three hours a day and I couldn't imagine this being my whole life while still having to go to school.
Having a baby is a huge responsibility, it's a job that is still hard for married adults. So why would you chance it when there is such a huge risk that not only effects you, but also the life of an innocent child? No one deserves to be born into a family that isn't ready for them or one that can't handle them. Everyone, not just Christians, should wait until they are married to have sex. This I Believe.

069240.txt,Cameron,,Under 18,"Atlanta, Indiana","September 2, 2009",2009,"I Believe in Kenny, the Fathr Almighty",death;morality;setbacks,"South Park is perhaps the greatest creation man-kind has ever created – far greater, in fact, than the light bulb, the space shuttle, and democracy.  It surpasses such literary works as The Odyssey, Moby Dick, and The Bible.  With such literary excellence comes one of the most complex, the most interesting, and the most terminal characters of all time – Kenny.  You may ask yourself, ""What is so great about this orange parka'd little boy?""  And I'll tell you – everything.  
Everyone one needs to follow the example set by Kenny McCormick.  First of all, he is the epitome of persistence.  Kenny consistently influences me to never give up in my pursuits, and, if I try hard enough, anything is possible; including dying multiple times only to come back for the next episode.  
Kenny has made me believe in the idea of second chances.  Sometimes things happen that make us think our life is over, (in Kenny's case, quite literally).  But often times, things fix themselves, though chances are we will be screwed again, perhaps sooner than anticipated.  To some this seems frightening; however, this philosophy presents a sense of freedom.  Why not make ourselves take risks? We're all going to die eventually – some more times than others. 
Let's not forget one of the most important, albeit tacky, traits of all – forgiveness.  Anyone who has died 13 times a year for 12 years could see how one might be slightly spiteful about the never-ending cycle of death, but Kenny is never fazed.  The blame on which ""bastard"" killed Kenny changes with each new day, but Kenny maintains a cordial attitude to anyone and everyone who has caused his death.
Though many ""respectable"" people may disagree, Kenny should be seen as a role model who should live through the generations.  I personally look up to Kenny as an honorable person who is willing to sacrifice himself in order to present me with lessons of ethics.  Kenny is possibly the most moral man who has ever stepped on the earth – after all, Jesus only died once.

Music is one tool that can cross ethnic, religious, and cultural lines.
Two examples of my belief are two artists John Lennon and Bob Marley.  John Lennon died December the 8th 1980, he was assonated.  Bob Marley died of cancer May 11th 1981.  Both men: different ethnic backgrounds, religious and cultural backgrounds.
 John Lennon famous song ""Imagine"" he relays a message.  In it he states, ""imagine all the people, living for today.  Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do, nothing to kill or die for, and no religion too.  You may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one I hope some day you'll join us, and the world will be as one.
Bob Marley famous song ""Could You Be Loved"" he relays a message.  In it asked, ""Could you be love and be loved? The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too.  So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you.  Love your brother man could you be loved?""
Yes this I believe music can be an effective tool although musicians may be deceased can make a difference. We all can come together as one.

069425.txt,Ashly,,,"Duncannon, Pennsylvania","September 8, 2009",2009,The Cynic,self-knowledge,"The serene music of chirping crickets and softly played classical melodies fill my ears as I sit hunched over a cramped desk in the corner of a dimly lit bedroom. The muscles extending across my back ache from the strain I impose against them, and the delicate layer of skin covering the back of my hand burns a glaring red from the oppressive heat of my desk lamp. All the while I sit in a state of half ignorance to my physical being, for I am thinking, thinking, and thinking ever more. What do I believe in, exactly? As I absently gaze at the checkerboard pattern of my light blue walls, I realize I could go on for days in telling of all the things I do not believe. I'll admit I am dumbfounded at the difficulty I now encounter in this newly set task. After all, I was never much of a cynic, was I? Bright blue squares begin to blur in my mind's eye as I am drawn into recollections of the recent past, which at once constituted as some of the most wonderful and complicated times of my life thus far. 
My flashbacks of summer begin with a brilliantly lit stage. I step lightly across, a smile stretching the corners of my mouth as I listen in a daze to the cheers and whistles of my peers and relatives, diploma in hand. Next scene takes place at a graduation party, where all bask in the proud glow of achievement. The atmosphere is more than engaging, though my eyes seem to repeatedly connect with those of my host, my friend. Fast forward slightly to a crowded nightclub, lights flashing all around as my friend and I are locked in rhythm, oblivious to the smirks and raised eyebrows of our companions. Despite this newly discovered infatuation, my friend and I decide to avoid emotional commitment, as we are both to go our separate ways upon the conclusion of two short months. A week or two passes by, marked by blissful mirth and longing gazes. Another jump, and I am informed that my visions of Maryland must be held back for yet another year. In the shock of having my carefully laid plans of college crushed so close to the goal, I retreat into myself. Unintentionally I distance myself from my friend, who then finds another. All the while I smile and laugh, though some unwelcome dull twinge creeps upon my heart. The end of summer arrives. We hug goodbye, strictly friends.
I am back to the present, blue checkers shifting into focus once more. As I sit here in thought, I finally realize what it is that I believe. I believe in this strained back, this burning hand. I believe these written reflections reveal more than I could admit otherwise, and that the cold steel of cynicism may be controlled by the simple stroke of a pen.

069626.txt,Bailey,,,"Rock Falls, Illinois","September 10, 2009",2009,Forgiveness Isn't Real,forgiveness,"Forgiveness is a word to be used with caution, because I don't think that people grasp its full meaning. I believe that forgiveness is never real. People say they forgive, but eight years down the road they still bring up that ""thing"" they supposedly forgave. Throughout my life I have had many instances that have led me to my belief.
I met my former boyfriend two years ago. We talked every day until our relationship grew closer. I thought he was ""the one"", so I shared with him something special that I could only lose once. After that night he wouldn't talk to me anymore. I was so hurt that I turned to other guys for comfort. Coincidently those boys were his friends.
As time went by, he started to talk to me as though nothing had happened.  Being the gullible girl that I am, I allowed him back into my life. He found out that I dated a few of his friends. He claimed he never stopped talking to me and that I just cheated on him. After a week of fighting he gave up and just said, ""I forgive you."" That was a lie.  Anytime we got into a fight, he would throw the times with his friends in my face even though he supposedly forgave me for it.
Another story I have was with my mom. I am the ""wild child"" of the family who was always in trouble, but I wasn't always like that. When I was younger, I was the sweet girl who listened to everything my mom and dad said.  As my high school years rolled around, my wild side started to show. I began to party a lot.  I was caught many times. I had lost my mom's trust completely. I am now an adult, and have gained back the trust of my parents for the most part. My mom says all is forgiven and it was just a stage of my life that I went through. Even though those words came from her mouth, she still makes jokes about drinking, which tells me she hasn't forgotten.
My last story is about my best friend. We were close until late in our senior year when everything began to unravel. My friend was going to church a lot. Suddenly she didn't want to hangout anymore, which confused me. One day I confronted her. She told me that she had grown close with God and she needed to get rid of the negative influences in her life.  I couldn't understand how she could say I was part of the ""bad"". A week later she came to my house and apologized. I forgave her. Even though I said those words, I couldn't fully forgive.
The past three stories are strong reasons that I don't believe in complete forgiveness. These personal experiences made me realize that no matter how much you say you forgive someone, you never truly can.

069641.txt,Robert,,,"Dixon, Illinois","September 10, 2009",2009,A Second Chance,forgiveness,"In America, we see in the news about an enemy or even a war with Iraq. Most of the time, America doesn't forgive. Contrary, I believe in second chances. One chance is all I will give for someone, who has betrayed me, to prove to me there will be change in the friendship.
There is one occasion that is a good example. I have been friends with this girl for over a year and there hasn't been anything wrong in our friendship. We hung out every day possible. She would buy my lunch, and I would do likewise. We spoke the truth because we were best friends.
Then there was this boy she liked. She began hanging out with him a lot. One night, he said to her I told people something only I knew about her. She jumped to conclusions and yelled at me when I did nothing wrong. I later found out she said some things about me. A month later, I thought about the situation and how it all came to be. Yes, she was in the wrong, but I gave her a second chance to prove to me there will be change. I am not one to hold a grudge. Therefore, I let this one slide. 
I treat my friends well. I have respect for them. Although, when people take my respect and throw it away, things don't turn out nice; which is what happened with one of my friends. She and I met when we most needed a friend. We experienced new things together. She was a listener when I needed one. 
One day, I was walking around when I was told this great friend of mine was talking about me. My head was about to explode. I have never said anything about this girl or even thought about it. I confronted her about it and she didn't deny anything. I walked away and ignored her. Months passed and I finally talked to her and expressed how I felt. She apologized and admitted she was wrong. I had to assure her if she ever did anything like that again, I wouldn't be back. We both understood we needed each other as friends.
I am headstrong, and that's why it takes me so long to forgive. There are times where it doesn't take so long for me to realize forgiving is the best option. My sister and I have the best relationship and turn the worst situation right side up. That was until I found out she said something private that only I told her. I couldn't believe my own sister would even think of betraying me. I got over it quickly because we talked it over and she apologized. Not talking to her would be hard for me.
There has to be trust for a friendship to exist. I don't take backstabbing very well. Betray me once, shame on him/her; betray me twice, shame on me.

069787.txt,Amaris,,,"Eloy, Arizona","September 14, 2009",2009,Growing Up,change,"Growing up things were never easy. Many times I just felt like I had no control over anything, not even my own life. My dad was one of those people you could call an alcoholic. He was never really around or involved in my childhood. The only time I remember him being around was when I could hear him and my mom yelling at each other across the hall. One minute they'd be screaming on the top of their lungs at each other and the next minute there was pure silence. I remember thinking to myself,""What if they hurt each other and that's why there's silence"", but then I saw  my mom's shadow coming down the hall. She came and peeked in the room to check up on me and my sister and my brothers just to make sure we were okay. When I seen my mom's shadow that's when I realized that the silence was because my dad had just walked out the door. That was nothing new to me. I just wondered when would be the next time I saw him again, because that's how it was every time they fought. My dad would always run away from his problems and we wouldn't see him until a few days later.
 As a child I always looked up to all the adults who surrounded my life. When they would accomplish something,I would tell myself I wanted to be just like them when I grew up.  I remember seeing women dressed in scrubs and I knew from then on that I wanted to be a nurse someday. They looked like they were happy with their life and that's exactly what I wanted. I wanted to get away from the life I always knew and for once be proud of something and make my family proud as well. I wanted to give my family everything I never had and I wanted my mom to have everything she deserved and worked so hard for.
As the oldest child of the family I knew I had a responsibility to be a role model for my younger sister and brothers. It was up to me to help them see life in a different way. All they knew was the life we had seen growing up, which was; our parents always fighting, our mom always depressed, our dad in and out of jail, and dealing with a parent who was an alcoholic and wasted his money on things other than what we needed. I wanted to show them that it's possible to grow up successful and be anything in the world they dreamed of. I taught them never to use our past as an excuse.
       My brother, who is the second oldest,hung out with kids who were trouble makers in Jr. High. They all acted like they were grown up and they thought they were tough. They came from families similar to ours. Most of their dads were a part of gangs or were never around to raise them right. They all did illegal things and really had no idea what life was about. I remember telling my brother one day, ""If you don't straighten up your life and make better choices now, you're going to go down the wrong path and end up like your friends"". He looked back at me with tears filling up his eyes and said,""After all we been through, I'll never want my kids to live how we did and I'll be stupid if I didn't learn anything from our past."" After that, I knew he had learned and finally wanted the same things I did. I knew he wasn't going to be like his friends who were all trying to be in gangs and act like their dads. After all, that's all they knew how to do.
       Very often these days, I hear people who have ended up nowhere blame it on their past experiences or life growing up. I believe your future is up to you and each individual person has a chance to change themselves. Whether they do so or not is completely up to them. I believe that your past should not determine your future and that you are your own person. I don't think it's fair to say you're a certain way because you grew up like that. My dad was a hardcore alcoholic and I learned many things from him. I thank him now because although I had it rough as a kid,I now have my eyes open to bigger and better things. I now have the advantage some people don't. That advantage is to learn from others' mistakes so that you don't get caught into it yourself.   
Today, I'm attending College and proud to say I'm the first one in my family to attend college. My career dream is to become a Registered Nurse and maybe someday a Nurse Practitioner. My hope is that many others will realize no matter what they've been through they can become anything they dream of. I wish that many others will decide to make a change in their life even if they are the first to do so. Every one of us has a chance to control our own destiny and that I believe!

Roof tops detached from their homes, floating in the water alongside dead bodies. Helicopters flying in the sky, trying to help those who were still alive. People in the Houston Astrodome, looking sad without food or shelter. This was Katrina and I watched it on TV. I was ten years old
   I believe everyone should have a place to stay. People have no homes will have no food to eat. The smallest little thing can do a big job, when hurricane Katrina hit many live were taken many house were broken down. This day forward children are getting killed for food.
    One day homeless people will have shelter. I don't like seeing people on the street with no food. I do my best to help I can't do it by myself. I need help. They need help. 
Katrina destroyed almost everyone dreams. In 2005 I watched it, it was the most heart broken thing. I thought to myself there are people with no homes. Katrina was said people lost people and their homes. As I was watching it ova and ova I cried. I wanted to help people because I knew if Katrina hit charlotte people would have helped us. 
The places that got hit by Katrina I will never be the same. Katrina caused people to drown which caused people to die. Katrina was very harmful. The people looking sad in the Houston Astrodome, wondering will things be the same. I think to myself everything will be ok. I believe that one day the places that got hit will become regular and homier enough for everybody to have a place to stay.
That was Katrina one of the main reasons I think people should have a place to stay. Katrina happened in 2005 and it can always come back. I pray and I hope that people will have a place to stay. I see this happening because I wouldn't want to be on the streets homeless. I also see this happening because I am going to do something about it.

As I sit here thinking about it I realize that many different kind of heroes exist: someone like batman or even as simple as your father. Consider a hero is anyone that you look up to and who stands tall in the face of adversity. As you think about it you will realize that you have a lot more heroes than you thought you sis.
I have a couple special heroes but one that proves really important to me: my sas. Since my childhood, he would stand up for me and always have my back; he stands tall in the face of adversity. Whether it involves sports, work around the house or even common sense. I consider my dad a hero not because he raised me, but rather because of what he does around me and for me. Like when my dad works around the house and he gives me tips here and there to teach me better and easier ways to do things. This makes him by far the most important hero and the most inspiring.
Barack Obama also serves as a hero in my life. Through it all he still goes strong and does his best to serve for his country. Just because the color of his skin he gets discriminated and hated by certain people and groups. He has taught me that just because I practice a different religion than most people and believe in different beliefs does not give people the right to treat me any less or more, as the same as Barack Obama. Who would have thought that we would elect a black president? I know I did not based on what the world has come to, but that did not stop him. He kept going and persevered. Obama never gives up and he has showed me that if I want something bad enough that if I work hard I can achieve it.
Clearly both my dad and Barack Obama count as big heroes in my life, things they have done have changed my life in ways I did not think were possible. Not only have they helped themselves improve but they also have helped me grow into the person that I want to become. When I say a hero means a lot in your life, I mean it!

I was a graceful person who follows the rhythm of music and I also experienced handling three official positions at the same time; I was a treasurer, an auditor of a student club and a president of a dance group. I used to wake up at four thirty in the morning almost every day to double check everything for a school program. The icy cold wind blew so swiftly that it touched my skin every now and then. It was so cold that my body doesn't want to get up from my bed and move. I glanced out and there I saw a few lighted houses. I didn't care if it was still dark. I went out handling the responsibilities my schoolmates believed that I can handle.
I've expected for a support some time on both of my academics and extra activities. There are some who prefers to text and call me after school just to congratulate me for achieving something. This is one thing that didn't felt coming from my parents. I felt the feeling of being ignored for something that everyone else, and even myself knows that I am good at. That's when my heart crushed into small pieces that no one could ever glue the pieces back together.  They never believed in me.
I felt bad one night when I got an award as a top achiever of our class because it seemed like they didn't care about it. They were only like, ""Oh okay. You've got an award, good for you."" I scribbled on my notes; I wrote everything that I could about the awful feeling that I had to ease the disappointment. That's the only time when I can be on my own inside my room. The same night, I had my reflection about my parents and on how I can make them believe in me. ""Tick-tock"" It was so quiet that I could even hear the ticking of the clock. Sitting on my bed beside the window, my tears ran so smoothly and slowly on my cheeks along with the cold wind coming from the outside. After all the hours passed and reflections that I had, I knew that I don't have to please anyone to believe in me. I realized that really had to stand for myself and do some things on my own. That's the time when I really felt disappointed of not having the support and realized that I do have to believe in myself and go for things that people never expects you to be successful of. I'll take a stand and let them see that I am strong. This brought me to the belief that I am living in right now —– Believing in your own self even others don't.

I was in no rush to grow up, but I had no chance for the kid part. I just jumped a level. But I dreamed with my eyes open and shut- always. 
Growing up, I didn't know my biological father; and my mother, as a single parent, worked all hours on the clock. For most of my time, I stayed with my grandparents which meant helping them clean houses. Man, I bet those houses are great to live in!
While I was getting a little older, I started taking care of myself. Every day after school I'd open my apartment, start homework, then clean and cook for my mom and I. 
The body on cars would capture my eyes. As my mom deposited a check, I'd daze at the cash and feel the electric touch transmitting from paper to finger, dividing each bill. I just had a desire for these kinds of material things.
I guess my mom always thought It'd be best for me to have a man around to help us, and she suffered trying to do so. When I heard the screams, the breaking glasses, and things hitting the floor like my mother and her tears, I knew I needed an escape. Repeatedly, I saw my mother and my family struggle. I saw how I could go down that road- But, I knew that life wasn't for me. 
In middle school, I somehow just lost faith in the experiences. Others the same, getting caught up in bad situations, made me question if fairytales were just fairytales. Not until high school had I switch it around. Many students reminded me of home- that fear. I just wanted to be my own person and learn everything I needed to know. So I did just that. 
        I believe knowledge will open doors to any place you can dream of. 
When I sit in class and observe how others act, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to have noticed, it's just so disappointing to know that I live in a generation where we're digging our own graves in America. Why have people in your life and do things that will keep us apart from success, America.  We seem so easily bored with life and too lazy to do something about it. When I grow up, I want to be proud of my country. 
I believe money makes this world go round, and I will be just another soul to sell. I hope what we offer will become valuable. I want to believe that everyone has a good cause for the world and will find a good place where they belong, I believe we are strong enough not to be misguided from that being possible.
I believe everyone is capable of being prestigious. I believe that I am a princess and I will see others near my castle in the sky.

072443.txt,Allen,,Under 18,"Claremont, North Carolina","November 3, 2009",2009,This I Believe,sports,"This I believe is that every body has they right to play sports, and not have to try out for any sport you just go out there and make a team, and that everyone has the chance to play and not have to sit on the side lines because they are not good enough to play. 
The reason why I believe this is because sometimes it is really hard not to make a team when you go tryout because you try so hard but you failed. Yea some people say that if you don't make the team that it gets you ready for life but I think that's bull crap. Every body should have the chance to make the team and play on the team.
Another thing that I believe in and that I want to talk about is that if you do make a team sport at your school or at an optimist club or something is that you get to play and not have to sit on the sidelines. Because think about it if you make a team and don't get to play but go out there every day and practice and do things for the team and is one of they hardest worker and still don't play that is heart breaking.
This is a really hard subject to talk about because I have gone out for teams and not made it before and it was hard knowing that you tried your best but you still wasn't good enough for the team. Believe this or not that a lot of the NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLB players didn't make a team before and failed but the next year they got back out there and made the team. Look at this people who ant good at there sport doesn't mean that they will never be good they just might be getting better.
This I believe is that when you work with the kids that are not as good as the other then they will get better if you keep working and working with them. That is why I want everyone to make the team and not have to tryout for the team because they aren't as good as everyone else.
Because some kids is not as good as others. Some kids just weren't blessed with talent to play all kinds of sport.
I believe that we as coaches should not tell the kids that they do not have enough talent they should not play. I think that the kids should find it in them self that and realize that they are not really that good at there sport. Then they want be as depressed as if the coach went to the kid and told him he literally ""suck"", And than if they boy doesn't realize that he really isn't  that good than just let him play.
I really hope that all of you coaches will see my prospective and know that it is the right thing to do.

This boarding school was Brewster Academy in New Hampshire, It was a beautiful school right on lake Winnipesaukee with about 400 Students total.  From my experience there I learned something that I have held as a core belief since that time.  Time is the most valuable substance at your disposal, so use it extremely wisely.  In an instant your life could radically change and things you would normally take for granted will no longer be there for you.  So always spend time wisely and make sure you value every minute of it.  When I was attending school there in my senior year, I decided to drink beer with one of my dorm mates.  We were caught the next morning and promptly expelled, because the school had a no tolerance policy on drugs and alcohol.  Within a span of about 24 hours I said goodbye for the last time, to many of the friends, I figured, I would have for a lifetime.  Only two individuals from Brewster have contacted me and seen me since I was expelled nearly 5 years ago.  My two best friends when I was at Brewster were Liam and Dean, and  they were those two.  I am glad I still have their friendship, however the complete rupture in time that was those last 24 hours at Brewster Academy did not leave me with the time to make sure I would keep in contact with most of the close relationships that I had at the time.  The shear distance of the school from my home also made this extremely difficult.  So most of that part of my life is gone, I will value it forever and the lessons that I learned in my 3 years in New Hampshire.  The biggest lesson I learned though, was to make every moment in my life precious, and value it, because that moment will never come to pass again.  Time is something we have so little of, and I feel that this may sound cliché, but making sure you spend that time living life to the fullest is one of the most important things an individual could do.  I can't even begin to say that in my life I have even done this.   Because every human being makes mistakes, but stepping back and gaining a perspective on how valuable your time truly is, is a very good thing to do.

072852.txt,Bob,,Under 18,"Lake Oswego, Oregon","November 16, 2009",2009,Failure for Success,,"""If at first you don't succeed, try, try again,"" is a famous American proverb that tells about how one meets failure once, or multiple times, only to get up and try again. One could never improve without failure. I believe one needs failure to succeed. 
Many people have met failure throughout their lives to improve to the level that they are at now. For example, Thomas Edison spent months of experimenting to build the first practical light bulb. He must have gone through hundreds of prototypes. As a result of his failures, Edison succeeded. I made it to the state chess tournament because of my advanced chess skills for the past four years. Every year I came home with either a second place or third place trophy. But last year I came home empty-handed. I felt grieved, but I realized that over the years, I became lazier and lazier in practicing, therefore, my skills declined. It also dawned to me that sooner or later, I had to lose. That means this year, I have to practice extra hard. 
If someone does not meet failure, then that means two things: one, that person has the quality of being perfect, or two, the person does not have a real challenge. The first possibility cannot be true; nobody has the quality of being perfect. The second possibility impedes that person's improvement. As a result of having failure, one could have hope. Hope makes you want to try again, but this time, with a harder force. This year, I have hope, so I am going to practice extra hard for the upcoming tournament if I want to win something. 
Failure brings sadness, hope, improvement, and ultimately, success throughout a person's life. That way, do not be afraid of meeting failure. One needs it to succeed.

In my childhood, I would run from school each day searching for my mother simply to say, ""I'm home"". My ten siblings and I faithfully held to this ritual until we went away to college. A family move from New Hampshire to Virginia in 1961 changed the stage, but not the performance. Home was our anchor, wherever we were.  
Mom would always ask how our day went. She was rarely fooled by our one-syllable responses, with an uncanny talent for drawing out of us the story beneath the surface. We kept little from Mom; she was a good listener and non-judgmental. She gave us plenty of room to grow. Home was safe and warm.
During my third year of college, the family moved back to New England. A new community and a new house didn't change home. Dad was an increasing presence in our daily lives. We became more vocal in questioning his long held political and religious beliefs. We were no match for his intellect, convictions and clearness of thought; these talks prepared us for the class and dorm room debates. Home was a place to learn and grow.
By the early 70's, marriages added new family to our home. The Thanksgiving table for thirteen grew by one, then three, four and more. Grandchildren scurried around their mémère trying to corral the family dog. The familiar smell of roasting turkey filled the air along with the sounds of a dozen conversations and holiday music. Home was a place to celebrate and love.
I recently visited my parents with my daughter-in-law and two of my grandchildren. In their mid-eighties, mom and dad now live in a small cottage on my sister, Michelle's, property. This marks the tenth house we call home. There is a steady stream of family who make the pilgrimage to this sacred place. Why do we come? There are no Wiis, video games or computers to entertain the kids, just an old dog and deaf cat. The great-grandchildren do what their forbearers did before them. They sit on my parents lap engrossed in spirited banter, their faces full of expression, hands exploring tender skin. Home is still a place of comfort and inclusion.
I am grateful for the generations who have been part of my life, my grandparents, parents, siblings, children and grandchildren. I think of laughter, shared joys and sorrows, love freely given and accepted, and a history that is warm like a glowing hearth and comforting like a tender touch. In the end, Home is our place in the universe, our comfort in this daily life, where no one has to deserve being there.

This is what I believe in. I believe that in football an individual can release things that in no other sport can be done. A person who is truly athletic can find his place in football. In football, you can also reap benefits like a scholarship or a job in the NFL; either one of those accomplishments is a major deal. If you wanted to increase your popularity, football is a great choice because people like to rally behind a team. Football boosts confidence and stops insecurity and also promotes working hard for something you want. 
     Football is an exciting and fun sport. The intense activity involves passion, anger, hard work, and a dose of brutality. Football is a sport loved by fans of all ages and drives players to play harder. Football has given some people a chance at life that without football they never would have had. I remember this time that I would never forget. I was in wreck league the league for everybody below high school. We were the championship team since we were 6 years old; we were unstoppable; we could take on any team and win. We were at the championship game as a undefeated team, we were all ready, pumped, and just overly excited. I was the starting tight end, and I was told I was good, but I just couldn't catch. I later came to find out that I needed glasses which explained a lot. In the game we needed the first down we were winning, but we needed to stall more time. This was my first big chance, and they wanted me to try something most thought was crazy: the seam route(a straight line pattern). I started to panic and my heart was racing out of my chest. The ball was snapped, and it began I ran as fast as I could then, as I turned back all became quiet. I sharpened my focus and pinpointed the ball perfectly. What happened next is that the ball came down so hard and so swiftly that it slipped through my hands, but then my facemask caught it. Everyone cheered as I yanked it out my facemask and ran from the 40 to the 20. This was a deciding factor in the game since it was a 3rd down and several yards. Since then when I realized I can make a difference, I pursued the life of football. Football changes lives I've invested money, time, and happiness. So that in the future I will be finically gifted.

073135.txt,Jason,,,"Linden, Virginia","November 20, 2009",2009,The Art and Artifice of Rationalization,prejudice;self-knowledge;tolerance,"I would argue that writer Robert Heinlein got closer to the mark than Aristotle, the Greek philosopher who gave the world the expression, ""man is a rational animal"", when he offered off the following simple elaboration:
""Man is not a rational animal, he is a rationalizing animal.""
I believe that Heinlein had it right, and that it's our ability to rationalize that sets us the farthest apart from other animals.  The older arguments, such as our having opposable thumbs or the ability to accessorize and use language, don't carry much water, as otters use stones to crack open muscles and Koko, the sign-talking gorilla, has a favourite handbag and communicates more intelligibly than some teachers I've known.
Sociologists argue that our ""primary social groups"" are responsible for creating our self-concept by projecting on to us their expectations which we in turn cater to, even if unconsciously, in our pursuit of social acceptance.  
Ironically, most people can see clearly over large expanses of space and time, recognizing how distant cultures perpetuate themselves – or change – one generation at a time, or how children imitate the parents when seeking their approval.  Yet when looking at our own lives, we are blinded by proximity.  We rationalize.  And as it is with herpes, or the elephant of personal bias that sits in on every discussion, comes to every dinner, and crashes every party, despite the statistics, few are willing to admit ownership.
For the same reasons, we might overlook a favourite uncle's trespasses as he trades racist jokes over the family reunion potato salad, and then, a day later, cringe and roil when the same epithets find our ears in the anonymous dark of a movie-theatre.  To deny the uncle amnesty and mete out the same measure of judgment we would for any other is hard enough to do simply for the influence of his sister, your Mother, and the devilish enchantment of his secret hotwing recipe.  Not to mention the leverage applied by years of Christmas gifts and birthday knee-rides.  Tolerance demanded in youth mutates over the years into rationalized acceptance.  Or maybe denial.  Or worse, a model for imitated behavior. 
Of all the things we learn to do as we quest for social equilibrium, for the comforts of approval and acceptance, it's a shame that we fail to invest in the habits of self-analysis, reflection, and honest critique, and instead seek out paths of lesser resistance.  
Allegedly, it takes the average person 200 milliseconds to recognize and interpret subtle facial expressions by a member of the same culture.  That's amazing.  But what makes that so amazing is the fact that it takes me hours to recognize the terrorist of rationalization that's hijacked any criticism of my own behavior when I visualize crosshairs over the tail-gater in the rearview mirror… only to hurl volleys of ire on the selfish jerk in front of me who just refuses to drive over the speed limit, like everybody else

Thinking about my life I realize I truly have to decide how to define my life. What defines me today? Is it what other's think and say about me, what others say I should do, or even what others expect from me? No, it is none of those things. What defines my life is what I think about me: I believe in myself. 
        I'm always overlooked; always the second choice – just an option, never a priority, yet it seems like I'm always being watched, judged and compared. I'm never good enough at or for anything and there is always someone waiting to let me know what I did wrong and what I could have done better. I'm never the best and, no matter what, someone always finds fault in me or my actions. 
        I'm funny, but not the funniest, smart, but not the smartest, athletic, but not the most athletic. Or, maybe, I'm opinionated, but too opinionated, happy, but too happy, nice, but too nice. In everything I do, everything I say, everything I wear, there will always be someone, somewhere who will have something to say and someone, somewhere will have done it better than me. 
        I have lived my whole life always being judged, compared, and never measuring up and finally, I became tired of it. I was sick of people always telling me what I did wrong and how I could have done it better. I was fed up with being compared to everyone around me. And I was done with it; I was done with everyone telling me how to live my life and how to be me. 
        I didn't care anymore about trying to please everybody and I didn't care about their silly ideas of what made perfection, of what made you good and what made you bad. I accepted the fact that, for some people, I'll never be good enough and in most cases there will always be someone better than me. But I had also realized something else, something that has given me the opportunity to still be the best I can be and not worry about measuring up to those who have unrealistic standards. I finally realized that I will always be the best me. No matter what, no one can ever be better than me at being myself.

073633.txt,James,,,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","December 1, 2009",2009,This I Believe,gratitude;hope;self-determination,"I believe God is going to use my life for something great.  I have been through so many life and death situations, that it's not funny.  The funny thing is that, I don't know fully what God has planned, but I know somehow.  If that makes any sense?  I escaped death many times.  From totaled car accidents to being shot with a 12 gauge, in my back.  In both incidents I walked away.  
The night I got shot was the first time I ever really prayed.  I was walking down the street, when all of a sudden; a car sped up and shot.  The blast was so loud, that it made my ears ring.  Next thing I know, I was laying on my back looking at the stars, with my ears still ringing.  So, I asked myself, ""Did I just get shot?"" That's when the heat and pain began.  From there I prayed out loud.  "" God, please let me walk, and don't let me die like this"".  People started to crowd around, so I stood to my feet and walked to my cousin's house.  To this day, I have 75 to 100 pellets in my back and arms.  It's really a miracle I'm not paralyzed.  
I also was in a predicament where a dude ran up on me and some of my friends; killing one of my close homeboys.  Shooting him twice in the chest, at point blank range.  The memory still hurts today.  
I have been incarcerated, where some people think suicide is the only way out. Chaos is normal, from prison riots to prison stabbings is just a way of life.  I'm not trying to scare or intimidate.  Matter of fact, I get scared at times myself, when I look back to the past.  
That's when I thank God for all he has done for me.  If it wasn't for God, I don't know how I would have made it this far.  So, I live everyday giving thanks for all God has brought me through.  Especially, for the life I don't have to live anymore.  I live positively and for God, focusing mainly on doing the right thing.  All the while praying that my dreams and aspirations line up with God's will.  
I wasted a lot of time doing negative things, hurting people and chasing bad dreams.  It took sometime, but I realized, when you do negative things you get negative results.  When you do positive things you get positive results.  It's just like what you learned growing up, in elementary school.  Negative plus a negative is a negative, and positive plus a positive is a positive.  It's not hard to understand.  It's just that when I was growing up in the inner city environment, I got confused.  I used to look up to drug dealers, because they had all the girls, money and nice cars.  Growing up, all the girls my age wanted the drug dealers, because they had money and a nice car.  So basically, I wanted to be like them and that's why I made a lot of bad decisions with my life.  To live that life, there's a big price to pay, and sometimes it might cost you your life.  
So, with the knowledge I have gained, I'm always living positively, talking to young people who remind me how I used to be, or walking that path I used to walk.  I do my best to explain that, that path is not fun if it involves a gun.

073706.txt,Kodie,,,"Marquette, Michigan","December 2, 2009",2009,This I Believe,humor & laughter;respect,"If you can't laugh at yourself
I believe in laughing at yourself, without it it's hard to be happy. Life in my perspective is a whole lot of disappointment and frustration with little bits of happiness thrown in. Now I have to live in those moments, but this belief has shown me how to take angry moments and turn them into funny ones you can laugh at. Before I decided that laughing at yourself was essential to my life I was a somewhat angry person who had a bleak outlook on life.
I see this world as a very angry place everyone. I have seen people get mad about the stupidest things, most of all words. I believe something much healthier to do is to just laugh it off. I laugh at myself instead of getting mad in my experience the other person will get bored and quit. When I first had started work at Culvers everyone was trying to make fun of me and give me a hard time. This is quite common in work places for new people. They would call me names and make fun of who I was. Also when I did something wrong they wouldn't be very subtle in telling me it was wrong. They would yell at me or point me out to everyone. I would just laugh about it, agree with them and move on. I wouldn't let their words get to me because words are harmless. One of my co-workers had a bad mishap. Now he was made fun of a lot for things he had done in the past and things he was now doing in the present. He would come into work on his days off. This is very looked down upon at Culvers. He would cry all the time about girlfriends and drama like that. That would end up in him being sent home way earlier then his shift suggested, it was frustrating. Everyone would tease him relentlessly.  One day another co-worker had crossed the line and thrown something at him in good fun. My other co-worker went in the back of the restaurant and go t a knife and was threatening another co-worker of mine. We then took action and restrained him until he was taken away and was fired and never allowed back into the franchise ever again. Now this could have all been avoided if he wasn't such an angry person and if he believed in"" If you can't laugh at yourself, life's going to seem a whole lot longer than you like.""
I believe in laughing at yourself. I believe it is a healthy thing to do. It makes me not as stressed and I'm able to cope with things much easier. Laughing at myself is the best medicine; it is my little way of enjoying life. I'm happy of whom I am and all the mistakes I've made in my life. I would never go back and change them.

074017.txt,Anreka,,,"arcadia, Florida","December 6, 2009",2009,This I Believe,self-knowledge;sports,"I believe that playing sports taught me the basic skills to survive in life, but left out the important ones.
To most people, basketball is just a game, but in retrospect, it helps lead to more of a goal oriented life.
In high school, I played every sport that I could. From Basketball to even weight lifting, I was there. Sports teach students things that our parents try to, but you just don't listen for some odd reason. I got several things out of playing sports such as: be respectful at all times, being a responsible individual is everything, and to be independent. In high school, these things are the only skills one need to survive in life, but in college out and out in the real world, these things help but aren't the main factors in life. Added to the skills that were already taught to me in high school, I have learned that you also need determination (drive), time management skills, and on that I would have never thought, selfishness. 
In high school, there are different aspects to life and we don't really see what life beholds for us, in college you find out things the hard way that one didn't learn in high school. We find out the true meaning of independent, selfishness, and determination. My definition of independent was, maybe here and there you could ask your parents for money, maybe even a friend, but as life goes on we find out who is really going to be there when we need them.
We have to be determined to get what we want in life. If you're not willing to bust your butt and do anything to get somewhere in life, there is plenty of people beside you that will and that are waiting for you to mess up.
Coming out of high school, I thought everyone was going to be nice. I didn't realize that this world was so cruel; being taught that if you are respectful, independent, and responsible you could get by in life. I quickly realized that those things do not matter. This world is cruel and to survive, we have to quickly learn to adapt.

074567.txt,Alyssa,,,"Louisville, Kentucky","December 11, 2009",2009,Stay at Home Moms: A Thing of the Past?,family,"Men are supposed to win the bacon, and women are supposed to fry it up in the pan.  This seemingly archaic and sexist statement has recently become a taboo in burgeoning and modern America.  With the rise of confident women and the access and equality in the working world, more women are abandoning their aprons and breaking the metaphorical ties to the stove to seek a more bread-winning role.  As a child growing up in a female-dominated household, I believe that women should be equal to men, but should cherish the role as a caretaker, educator, and remain, the once revered, homemaker role.
Being a young child trying to survive school and all of the challenges it entails, can be a difficult task in itself, but having a mother that makes more money than her husband is surprisingly difficult.  I successfully dodged questions about my father's job and even had a detailed and elaborate cover story to shield my embarrassment.  Knowing that every other child's father was a doctor or lawyer made me feel inadequate and many times was the cause of constant ridicule from many of my fellow classmates.  Growing up attending Catholic schools enabled me to achieve great academic heights, but throughout the years, I was tested with many sexist, monetary hoops that I had to jump through.  I never had a mother that woke up extra early to make a hearty breakfast, pack my specially made peanut butter and jelly sandwich with the crust cut off, or have her wait for me to finish school.  Because my mother was always at work, I had to wait after school every day for three hours for my dad to get off work to pick me up.  Having an absent mother enabled me to attend private schools, have the best clothes and the nicest cars, but the years of ridicule and hours of waiting to go home was not worth it.  I am in no way a sexist, or feel that all unmarried women should find a financially stable husband, settle down, and have kids; I am just a strong proponent of women staying at home to care for her children emotionally not just financially.  
If families have the means, there are many benefits of having a stay at home wife or mother.  Hundreds of dollars are spent monthly on comprehensive day and childcare.  I understand that it greatly benefits some families, but think of all the sickly children that un thoughtful parents, who are unwilling to miss a day's work, send to  daycare.  Before day's end, a perfectly healthy child could have come in contact with a germ-infested child multiple times.  By the time the child wakes up the next day for another germ overexposure day, he or she has already contracted a handful of illnesses that could have otherwise been avoided.  In the end, one child's illness can cost a family hundreds of dollars in medical bills and medication.  But having a stay at home mother could have alleviated the problems.  So at first, having a wife stay at home to care for children may seem financially impossible, but it can not only save a family thousands of dollars a year, it can also increase the much needed emotional support for the kids.  
All throughout my childhood, my mother worked long hours and many times spent the moments she should be spending time with me and my family, sleeping.  As a young girl, I didn't understand why my mother did not spend any time with us, and I really began to resent her and her job.  I felt that my mom enjoyed spending time at work rather than taking the day off to spend time with my brother and me.  Luckily I had him to share all of my young life's experienced with.  Having an older brother can be very beneficial to a young girl, but when he becomes the only consistent human connection, one could end up being very shy and out of place.  Many games and outings consisted of very boyish things like fishing, camping, or playing football.  Though the games never bothered me, and because I did not have a strong motherly influence, I unknowingly started to change into a tomboy.  None of the girls at school wanted to play with me because I always played too rough.  I hated Barbie.  She was me and my G.I. Joe's worst nightmare, and I truly resent my mom for not having more of an influence in my life and showing me how to be more like a girl.  Mothers are also responsible for the immediate shaping and education of their children.  Without a mother children would not possess some of the basic human characteristics and pleasantries, such as knowing to say ""please and thank you"" or chewing with their mouths closed.  I cannot count the number scraped knees or bruised elbows that I wish that my mother would have been there to kiss the boo-boos and make it all better. There are many things that children require that only a mother can give or handle, and if a mother is not present during the crucial times in her children's lives, they can miss out on life-altering experiences. 
So with the rise of many gender equal jobs, more women are entering the working world to pursue loftier career aspirations, while many more children are being left to raise themselves.  I hope that one day that I will be financially privileged enough to be a stay at home mother for my kids and husband.  Having a stay at home mom benefits children not only mentally but emotionally as well, and I feel that all children should know the satisfaction of having a full time mother.  I will always believe that being a stay at home mother is the hardest but most rewarding job a woman can have, and that all women should feel privileged that they are able to be the ones to shape and mold the young minds of today's children.

Different experiences in a person's life will help them realize who their loyal friends are.  My life experiences have been influenced by people's morals that are both genuine along with those whose are shallow, but my relationship with my most faithful friends have motivated me and have pulled me through life's challenges. Among my friends from school, work, sports, and other activities, there is one who stands out more than the others; that friend is Ryan. Ryan and I have been friends since he moved into my area in the 4th grade. Throughout the years, we have had many experiences both good and bad; however, we have always helped each other along the way. Two incidents I have had in particular make him my most dependable friend.
One winter night after attending a high school basketball game with Ryan, I decided to go home, while he went out to dinner with some other friends. It had just finished snowing and the roads were incredibly icy. Driving on one of the back roads, I took one of the corners too fast, lost control and collided into a steel pole. Terrified after the collision, I called Ryan crying and told him what had just happened. Although he was having dinner, he told me to sit tight and said he would be right there to help me. Ryan frantically left the restaurant and his friends without paying or saying goodbye, and rushed to where I was. He helped me get out of the totaled car, called for more assistance, and stayed with me the whole night, supporting and comforting me. He did not care that he had left dinner and his friends; all that mattered to him was that I was going to be all right. 
Another tough time he helped me get through dealt with my ex-boyfriend. After I had been together with my boyfriend for three years, the break up made me feel like I had hit rock bottom. I called Ryan crying and talked to him about what had happened, until he told me he had to go do something, to get some rest, and he would call me back. After about an hour and a half, I heard knocking at the door. I got up from the couch, peeked through the window and saw Ryan standing at my doorstep with a bouquet of flowers in his hand. We talked the night away and he helped me with my troubles until he had to head home later that evening.
These experiences have helped me realize that a true friend is one that is loyal and will always be there for me. Ryan is one of those friends that I can always count on and will never forget. I'm very thankful for all the times he has been there for me, and am grateful to have him in my life. 
I believe in loyalty.

When you are sad, you listen to a certain type of music that you can relate to. When you are happy, you listen to jumpy music that makes you smile. I believe it is physically impossible to live your life without enjoying music in some form or fashion. You cannot escape music because it's everywhere: at home, at work or school, at the grocery store, on the radio, on TV… Everywhere you are, there is some form of music playing. Music can be relaxing, exciting, saddening, exhilarating, excruciating, and any other emotion that you let it be. It molds to whatever you need it to be whether it is a pillow to hold, a shoulder to cry on, or a smile to receive. It is needed in life in order to keep our emotions in line and to help define our moods.  
Whether you play music, listen to it, fall asleep to it, or dance to it you enjoy it no matter what. Whether it's classical, punk, rock, alternative, screamo, or country. What is found in your ipod, mp3, CD or record collection shows your personality and the most recent songs played show how you cope with every day life. Your music defines who you are and you cannot avoid it, let alone avoid enjoying it. I believe life would be very sad and unfortunate without music to fill everyone's ears. Music is a great part of culture and a beautiful way of showing who you are deep down inside. Without it, expression would be difficult and rather confusing for those who have a hard time putting thoughts on paper. 
I believe music is inevitable in life. Everyone has his or her own play list that is the sound track to their life. Your character and personality interpret who you are and what music you listen to and what actions you take. When people come together to listen to the same type music, it creates an aura of friendship and understanding that isn't always found in normal, everyday activities. Music brings people together in ways that not many people understand. Therefore it is not only inevitable, but also necessary.

They would many things together, and got involve in each other's lives. They looked really happy together. Then there was a day that she told me they broke up, that they were not together no more. She wasn't the same. She looked sad, but I never thought it would be love. 
I would ask her what was wrong with her, but I think that just hurt her. So I just left her alone and didn't ask her about their relationship again. Time passed by and I entered to my sophomore. I was growing up. In the beginning of the year I was just focused in school, my family, and friends. I don't know when it happened or how it happened but I started to get a different feeling about a certain guy. There was one guy, his name is Ricardo. We had gone to the same middle school, and we known each other since then.
We started talking more and more as time went by. He moved school on freshmen year, because his parents saw he wasn't doing well. The people he hanged around with were a bad influence. His parents wanted him to do well in life. He told me that he missed it over here, he missed his friends. The people he was around for a long time. I didn't realize it, but one day when I was with him I started feeling different. I started to get shy around him and he would turn really red. I didn't know why I was feeling like that. He told me he liked me, and at that time I realized I liked him too. We got together in November 3rd of my sophomore year. 
We have been together since then. Now I realize that you need someone to love and for them to love you back. It feels good knowing that a person out of nowhere can change your life and you could change theirs too. What I feel for him is so big that now I understand why my cousin was like that. Just to imagine being without him would really hurt me. We are lovers and friends. I have helped him so much on his education, and he has been there for me all the time through all my problems. His advices have really helped. We are there for each other all the time.
I am very thankful for having him in my life. He is my love. I think that love could change every person. Doesn't matter how a person is they will change once they find love or at least go through it. I did and now I do believe in love. It still is silly but it's called love.

075216.txt,Nicholas ,,,"Deerfield, Illinois","December 17, 2009",2009,The Late Night,self-knowledge,"I believe in the power of the late night. I am not talking about late nights neck-deep in paperwork or wide-eyed insomnia, but rather, staying up late for no particular reason whatsoever. Ever since my childhood, I saw my predetermined 'bed time' as cutting the day short. Once my head hit the pillow, my day was over, and I rebelled against this by seeking any added minute away from my bedroom. A 'bed time' of 10:30 suddenly became 10:45. 10:45 then became 11. It wouldn't be until 11:30 that I would finally hit the lights with a sense that I had won back that precious hour of my day that would have otherwise drifted away from me. 
There is a uniqueness about being awake late at night that sticks with me even today. It's the eerie glow of late night television that fills up the dark room, and the infomercials preaching money-back guarantees and washboard abs in 20 minutes or less. It is the shadow that the blades of the ceiling fan make overhead, or the ominous hum of the refrigerator in the background.
Looking out the window, I see the world in a different light. I see it with a new perspective. What normally would be a view of the busy world that I have grown so accustomed to suddenly becomes the view of baron streets shrouded by the glow of distant streetlights. There is an overwhelming peacefulness in the world at this hour. The noise of daily life is replaced with a calming silence, and this silence makes me think. There is not much else you can do at this time of night but to just think. You may think about whether the moon should be out at this time even though you know nothing about astronomy. You may see a single window illuminated across the street or a lone car drive past and ironically wonder what someone could possibly be doing up at this hour. Most importantly, in this time that would otherwise be lost, what I think about is myself and I reflect. I'm free to look at the day I had and the day I might have tomorrow. I'm free to regret, to anticipate, to fear, or to hope. 
I believe that the late night brings life simplicity. It is as if time stands still, and you are floating carelessly between your past and your future, where today is not over and tomorrow has not begun. This gives me peace of mind knowing that I don't have to leave today or face tomorrow until I'm ready. I'm free to just be who I am, right now, in this moment.

075306.txt,Matthew,,Under 18,"a, Washington","December 18, 2009",2009,Mistakes are a part of Human Nature,self-determination,"Procrastination never pays- a concept that seems harsh to me but, I still do it. It is something I do all of the time. Who needs responsibilities? Can't we just do whatever we want? Can't we make them go away just by wishing so? Well not really, things don't work that way. I too have learned of this.
Back in my middle school days, homework always came last on my ""to do"" list. From there I could do anything I wanted besides homework; which I guess was fun, until the day before it was due. In the end, I would spend the whole day and night working on homework I could have done earlier. That meaning I would be punished with the jealousy of watching my family go to sleep earlier than I did, and having a whole day go to waste. Along with that, a long school day stood ahead of me, and going through a school day half asleep is not a good experience.
Eventually I should have learned from all of the procrastination. I should have, but sadly I did not. So what? I only have to start doing things on time now right? Nope, not quite. You can't just shake it off like it is nothing. It's like any other habit out there, it sticks with you. No matter what you try, it never seems to go away. Even if it is not a good choice, I keep doing it anyways because it is so much easier.
Maybe it's not just a habit though. Perhaps it is a state of mind, a way I am constantly thinking. Maybe it's not my laziness, but actually my fear: of taking the initiative, of criticism, of going through change- ultimately my fear of making mistakes. 
The change I might receive. The mistakes I might make hold me back all because I let them. My potential sits in the distance, waiting for my call; yet I have not even decided to. The perfection I can't reach is shutting me up and locking me up in my own prison of a mind.
I can still see it though, my potential, sometimes right next to me even within grasp. Now I must put my imperfections aside and learn to accept my mistakes. Rather than dodging them, I must tackle them with full force, and ensure myself I'm the one who is left standing. The first step though is to believe. To believe perfectionism hinders potential. To believe that perfection is not possible, and mistakes are a part of human nature.

075572.txt,Dona,,Under 18,"Sandy, Utah","January 3, 2010",2010,The Challenge of Life,self-knowledge;sports,"I have lived exactly 5,745 days.  During that relatively miniscule period of existence and experience, I've realized I have very little comprehension of this dense and overwhelming world. The number of days I have lived is nothing compared to the immense amount of confusion I've felt, the number of mistakes I've made, and the unacceptable amount of people I have disappointed along the way. It seems like it's on the verge of impossible to figure out yourself, let alone figure out all the secrets of this gigantic world. I've already been through so many of the challenges of life, I've seen challenges that I will soon come upon, and I know that there are challenges out there that I have never imagined or will ever desire. I know that I'm here for a purpose, and I'm ready to overcome all adversaries that may step in my way. 
The complexity of thinking about what will happen and what has happened is just an excuse to not live in the ""now."" I should just be worrying about the present. Tomorrow is just another day and yesterday was just another experience, but today is right now. Right now it's my job to make good choices and learn from my ""yesterday"" experiences and mistakes. Right now it's time for me to help others. Right now it's time for me to become the best possible version of myself. Right now it's time to love and appreciate the beauty of family. Right now it's time to realize that I have some unbelievable, trustworthy, and down right incredible friendships.  Right now it's time to be accepting. Right now it's time to stand up for what's right. Right now it's time to include all those who are alienated. Right now it's time for me to appreciate all I've been given, and help those who aren't as fortunate. It's living in the present that helps us become better people, and by becoming better people we take one step closer to finding out the true meaning of life. 
 I am continuously motivated in my daily life by my competitive instinct; consequently I view life as a challenge. Have you even thought why we are all different? Each person is a different combination of races, religions, attractions, personalities, and fears.  Each has a distinctive, unique personality; each person is an individual. As humans we have the right of human dignity, therefore it's our challenge to accept each individual. We each have our own likes and dislikes, but our preferences do not give us the right to devalue or dismiss people for being different. The biggest challenge that I've experienced in life is accepting those who are different, not judging others, and loving this entire unique and diverse planet. This challenge is so frustrating and time consuming that it's truly a test of my character trying to overcome it. I hope that one day I will have the strength and courage to overcome this challenge, and on that day I hope that I will find my true self.
This may sound naïve, but I think the game of basketball has taught me the most about life. Basketball is a game of talent, athleticism, respect, teamwork, dedication, strength, courage, knowledge, skill, and passion. The game transcends beyond simply who scores the most points or who has the most blocks. This game is primarily about the trusting of teammates, respect for the athleticism and skill of your opponent, and the drive to be the best. I have met so many amazing athletes and friends and incredible people because of this unbelievable sport. Everything that my coaches, teammates, and opponents have taught me will help guide me through the rest of my life. Basketball has given me so many wonderful opportunities and experiences that some people can only dream of. 
Fifteen years is not nearly enough time to completely understand this world. People who have lived over a hundred years can't even fully comprehend the complexity of this world. Our world is full of beauty, grace, good, evil, consequences, love, family, friendship, enemies, hate, betrayal, peace, justice, kindness, envy, lust, desire, hope, faith, confusion, forgiveness, life, death, joy, devastation, sadness, colors, disease, sloth, adventures, searching, courage, disappointment,  insecurities, privileges, prudence, care,  fortitude, bravery, sacrifice, charity, etc. Our world is full of words, but it's the definition of each word that effects and truly defines our world. I have no idea what this world has in store for me, and what words I will experience in my short time here. I have no idea which words can truly define me or my place in the world. All I know is that I'm ready; I'm ready for the challenge of life. I'm ready to find which words I will encounter and I'm ready to find the words that define me. I'm ready for life, love, happiness, fulfillment, adventure, truth, justice, peace, faith, hope, security, family, friendship. This I believe: I'm ready for it all.

I like being able to choose Escape the Fate over Miley Cyrus. I like being able to choose to dye my hair brown over blonde. I like being able to choose Mac over Windows. I like being able to choose to being an atheist over being a christian. This I believe- in choices.
One of the biggest controversies in the United States is the pro-life/pro-choice debate. People argue that termination is murder and that abortion shouldn't be used as a form of contraceptive. They say it's immoral. They say that if a teenager is getting an abortion because they're too irresponsible to deal with a baby that they have no life experience and will regret what they've done. They say the solution to getting rid of a child you don't want, won't love, or can't take care of is giving the child up for adoption. Why punish the child?
Fact: only three percent of unmarried white females give up their children for adoption. Even less for an unmarried black female because ultimately it is the mother's choice. Sentience is invaluable, but every child should be a wanted child. Why punish a fetus that cannot exist outside the womb attached to an umbilical cord and is therefore not a separate entity? (It's not a life which means it's not murder!)
Honestly if I was put in that situation, I don't know what I would do, but I like having the choice so I'm not forced into a miserable life for not only myself, but for an innocent child. I believe in choices. I believe that pro-life is anti-constitutional. If we take away a woman's right to control what happens inside her body, we take away her civil rights as a citizen of the United States. You might as well legalize rape while you're at it.

     I've made plenty of mistakes, that I no longer have to regret. Many of mistakes that made my lifestyle seem obscene to others. Maybe it's the way I said it or maybe even the way I did it, but it shouldn't really matter because no one's perfect. Why live life so sadly, when you don't know tomorrows reliance. If you were to laugh now and then cry later, there would be no point of living life.
     Just as if you love, you will give your all. When it's finally gone, you can never get it back. You live to have a life, just like you laugh when you are happy and you cry when you are sad. Then when you realize God has a plan for you, so you wonder ""Why should I sit here and complain and be unhappy when I can choose to be?"". Then if you were more happier you can learn to enjoy life and accept life for what it is today then what it can be for tomorrow.
     There's so many tears I cried wondering why did this happen to me and why doesn't anybody understand the way that I feel. Years past and guilt and unhappiness started to wonder out of my body and I wondered deep inside of myself and I found me. A person who deserves to live each day to the fullist, only because tomorrow isn't promised. I try to smile as much as I can, so people can remember me as smiles and never frowns. Maybe my smiles and laughter can brighten up the next persons heart and personal feelings that they may have saw me inside, that they now know what kind of person I really am.
     Sometimes I am misunderstood, I mean being a 17 year old girl, I should have as much fun in life as I can. I live by these years to watch people my age and maybe even younger go by fastly. They never even got a chance to enjoy thier lives and it's very heartbreaking. Some never even got a chance to fall in love and some never even had a chance to enjoy high school. I know if they had a chance to thier life to the fullist, even just one time they would do everything in world that is intended to do, because they already know that life is not promised.
      I strive to express myself in the best way I can. I try to get people to understand me. I have fun to enjoy myself. I make mistakes that some people say I should regret, but it's another story I can tell so I can laugh. I accept people for who they are because I would want somebody to accept me for who I am. I love the people that I choose to love, only because deep inside, they make me happy.
     I live, cry, laugh and make mistakes only because in the end life isn't promised, so live life as if you were to die tomorrow!

075862.txt,Berkley ,,Under 18,"Mechanicsville, Virginia","January 11, 2010",2010,Everything Happens for a Reason,family;illness,"I believe everything happens for a reason. My mom used to tell me this whenever life hit me in the face. However, now I tell this to myself when I have struggles. I didn't believe in this until I had a couple imperfections in my life. I wish I would have lived by this quote during those hard times, but everything happens for a reason. 
When I was in fourth grade I realized I didn't live in a perfect fantasy world anymore. One day I was looking in the mirror, and I noticed my eyes were a yellowish color. My mom took me to our pediatrician and they gave me a finger prick. The doctors told me my hemoglobin blood count (red blood cells) was a four, and it was supposed to be a twelve. This was obviously not normal and I needed immediate care. I remember seeing my mom's face, she looked petrified. My parents took me to MCV hospital; while I was there, I was surrounded by cancer and trauma patients. I felt like I was in a surreal world. At the hospital the specialist confirmed I had hemolytic anemia. This is when your body kills your red blood cells for no reason. I was only in the hospital for a week, however, they gave me tons of blood transfusions, and I was put on several medications.  
When I went home, the torture wasn't over because I had to be followed weekly in a hematology clinic to receive more blood transfusions and get my blood count checked. I was also put on a medication that made my face swell up, have trouble sleeping, and a lot of other horrible side effects. At this point of my sickness, I hated being around people and attending school was a nightmare. I didn't understand why this had to happen to me, and during these times, I hated being me. As the years went on, the doctors found medications that stabilized me, and I am currently in perfect health. This crisis made me look at life in a whole new way, and, consequently, I grew up at a young age. 
Ironically, five years later and two days before my brother's graduation, he was diagnosed with the same rare blood disorder. The doctors were shocked and thought there was no way he could have the same diagnosis. Sure enough, he fought through it like I did. My brother struggled with a far more complex and stubborn case. It was the most painful and heart breaking feeling watching my brother experience something I had to go through. After months of tackling this disease, the doctors have stabilized him as well. 
Looking back on these times, I have truly realized they made me into who I am today. I feel more compassionate to others, and I appreciate the little things in life every day. I believe you should not dwell on the negative issues in your life, but use them in a positive manner. These crises happened to me for a reason, and I know for a fact one of the largest reasons is that they were meant to give me more strength in tough situations later in life .I believe everything happens for a reason, there for my brother and I were meant to be sick. As some may say, ""What doesn't kill you will only make you stronger.""

075963.txt,Julian,,,"Palm desert/CA/92260, California","January 13, 2010",2010,Everything happens for a reason,family,"I believe that everything happens for a reason; people come and go specifically for a reason. People die, and are born for a certain reason, maybe to bring together a family that is falling apart, maybe to teach us the real values of life. Maybe to teach us all that in the end it doesn't matter what possessions we have around us, the only thing that matters is who we have around us.
I believe that everything happens for a reason. My grandmother is a mother of five children and was the most powerful woman I ever set eyes on. She single handedly sheltered and fed 5 children in a poor village in Hong Kong, and continued to work hard carrying out multiple physically demanding jobs until her 70's. After finding out she had cancer, and going through multiple sessions of chemotherapy we learned that the cancer had spread to multiple organs and all hope was lost. It was on my family's last trip to Hong Kong when I would get to see her last. I remember the cap she wore to cover up the hair she had lost through chemo. I remember how delicately everyone treated her. And I  remember how my grandmother would take me aside everyone else and eagerly try to put her wisdom into me, I remember her exact words in Cantonese, "" Sek Lega Ma"" which means ""love your mother"" and ""take care of your mother"" and I could see her eagerness to make her one last influence on me. 
But one thing I remember most, is seeing all of her children, including my mother, and all of her grandchildren realize what they are losing. I remember seeing my mother and how much she cherished being next to her mother for what would be one of the last few days. I could see how everyone learned to cherish life from that point on and appreciate what they have and keep the relationships between each other strong. I could see how my grandmothers passing happened for a reason and helped us realize the real joys in life; being with one another.
My Grandmother's passing did not only teach me how precious and short life is, but it also helped me realize that your possessions are useless in the end. In the end my grandmother wouldn't have cared if she was sleeping on a piece of cardboard on the street by the gutter. As long as she passed with her children and her grandchildren by her side she was rich beyond her dreams.

076024.txt,Shelby ,,Under 18,"Louisville, Kentucky","January 15, 2010",2010,When was the last you did someting for someone else without wanting a reward for yourself?,good & evil;goodness & kindness,"When was the last time you did something for someone else without wanting a reward for yourself? I live in a neighborhood with many elderly people and they mean the world to me. A few years ago we got a lot of snow, and knowing that they couldn't get out of the house and go to dialysis or to the doctors I went and shoveled there driveway. I didn't want anything for doing this but knowing that a few minutes out of my time could make life for this couple a little easier, was priceless. It doesn't stop there though; there have been many days where I go down there and visit to see if they need anything and me and my mom sometimes go down and help them with their shots. 
Many people think that you have to go up to someone and give them money or a possession in order to effect or help someone in need but that is not the case at all. Whether you smile at someone who's having a bad day, or even shovel a driveway for someone they need it that means just as much if not more to them. Every time I see Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds they cannot thank me enough but to me it's not a big deal at all. They are the sweetest people! Mrs. Reynolds has made me many things such as a quilt, dishrags, stitched me some pillow cases, and many other things to put in my treasure chest to think of her and her husband later in life. But, this couple will always be near and dear to my heart. Her making me these things means so much more to me than her walking up and giving me money. People need to realize in the world today people don't need money to make their day, but they need love and the realization that there are people here to help them get through the day. Many people are so caught up in material possessions that they only think of themselves and don't care for others around them. 
In saying all of this, I realized how much me doing these little things for them meant after Mr. Reynolds past away last week. She thanked me for being there for her and her husband through everything, and she has told her family all about me and my family. Not only that but when I talked to her daughter at the funeral home and found out that she was inspired by what me and my mom have done that she is helping the elderly in neighborhood. That's when it hit me, that the little things in life are what matter the most and you don't need any money for a reward, or for doing a kind deed but instead you need to encourage others to do the same thing so that many others are helped in the process, and for people to realize that they can make a difference.

076179.txt,Katherine,,,"West Lawn, Pennsylvania","January 18, 2010",2010,Learning to Fall,sports;work,"A split second before I fell, I knew what was going to happen. I had lost my balance on the last turn and the upcoming turn would unseat me altogether. I had seen it happen countless time, girls hitting the ground as horses unknowingly continued on. Logically, I understood that I would fall, someone would catch my horse, someone else would help me up, I'd shakily laugh it off and everything would be alright. 
It was strange, finally finding myself on the ground, unable to move anything below my waist without experiencing intense pain. Later, my riding director would describe to me that I landed mostly on my right hip, then instantly curled up on my side. Hers was the first voice I heard, saying repeatedly, ""Don't move, I'm coming."" I didn't cry until she helped me up and then eventually carried me to a more secure place, the barn's feeding shed. Now lying on a mountain of hay, I listened as everyone puzzled out my diagnosis: there were no obvious bruising or cuts and there was no way I could have broken my femur, but throbbing pain prevented my ability to even shift my right leg or lower back. A medical emergency was proclaimed and I asked whoever called my mother to wish her a happy birthday. At the hospital, an x-ray, a cat-scan, and eight grams of morphine later, the doctor told me that I had fractured my sacrum, a bone around the pelvis and tailbone. Although I was supposed to leave for Ireland in three days, the doctor informed me that I wouldn't be going anywhere near that plane. I cried. 
My injury was not remarkable, especially in the world of athletes, but it changed my perspective on daily life. As a result of this experience, I believe in greeting each day as a new day full of endless possibilities. At first, I was incredibly depressed that I would be stuck at home and probably in pain for the remainder of my summer, but that feeling quickly disappeared. I was alive, with a minor injury that would heal in a mere twelve weeks when instead I could have snapped my neck. Yes, I was living on my couch, unable to move without assistance. However, after three days, I could sit up, lie down, and stand with crutches by myself. These small successes gave me motivation and inspiration to wake up every morning and to do something with my day. I persevered with the idea that today isn't nearly as bad as yesterday and tomorrow will be even better, and that idea has stayed with me. I believe that concentrating too much on negative experiences will only cloud a sunny day. Little gestures of support, such as postcards from friends in Ireland, gave me endless reasons to stay positive, and I believe in focusing on even small moments of happiness in order to overcome negativity. In learning to ride, we must also learn to fall. This I believe.

077434.txt,Janice,,,"Normal, Illinois","February 11, 2010",2010,I Believe Adults Should Spend More Time Coloring,creativity,"I believe that adults should spend more time coloring. Coloring books should not be reserved for children. It's a crime against society that this is the case. 
The act of rubbing pastel pink across the page feeds my sense of self.  The sensation of a waxy tip gliding across dull white pages and creating brilliant dreams feeds my need to believe in magic. Watching a small piece of the world get slowly and neatly brighter creates an immediate sense of victory. Good over evil. Triumph over tragedy.  At less than five dollars a shot, it's the cheapest therapy money can buy.
There are few things in life more exciting than the moment I receive an unspoiled coloring book and a fresh box of crayons. When I color, my mind is in the first grade and I relive the first moment I popped open a box of Crayola 64s – with the built in sharper. I turn back the lid and gasp as my eyes consume a rainbow of pinks, reds, blues and greens. They are lined up with their heads held high. I savor the scent of wax and consider how each will contribute to my design. 
I pull out the first color, roll it between my fingers and read the label. Hello, Brick Red. You are strong and dark. I can use you to shade the chimney. There you are Burnt Sienna. Though you are a dull clay hue, you'll do nicely for the flower pot. Turquoise Blue, soft and calm, you will span the sky scape. 
I believe that The Coloring Adventures of Scooby Doo and an eight pack of primaries should be standard issue at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Think how much calmer everyone would be if they could renew a license after turning the Mystery Machine into a Midnight Blue and Melon mini-bus. It might even help improve smiles on the ID Photo cards.
Airports, I believe, should be littered with My First Looney Tunes Coloring Book and a thick set of Magic Markers. Then no one would care that their flights had all been delayed two hours because of a thunder storm in Toledo while their luggage had been diverted to Topeka. And the biggest concern would be remembering to place the cap back on the Razzle Dazzle Rose.
I am certain that coloring books in the hands of adults could be the missing step to World Peace. The United Nation's next order of business should be to declare an International Day of Coloring. And henceforth, all border disputes should be settled by holding a Free Drawing Fiesta.
I believe you should envy me. I am lucky. My position as a parent permits met to sit with my children and color to my heart's content. I can color the sea Canary and sketch the sky Salmon. I can draw Denim daises and paint Purple pandas. I can become one with the wax.  Zen and the Art of Coloring Books.
And, most important, I believe I can color outside the lines. And no one can stop me.

Many things I do or try to achieve are because of the strength and love that God gives me every day. I think that without God, I would be at a crossroads and I wouldn't be able to decide what to do. 
One miracle came at a time when I least expected to need one. I was on a way to a baseball game with some friends and one of their parents. We stopped to get gas somewhere in northern Kentucky. We had started our journey again and we had to take a windy road to get back onto the interstate. As we came upon a blind turn, the driver received a phone call and proceeded to answer it taking her hands off of the wheel. As we came upon the turn the passenger quickly grabbed the wheel and jerked us back onto the road. We spun out of control and almost barrel rolled off of the road. If it hadn't been for the safety that God gave me that day, and during that car ride, I don't know what would have happened.   
He performs miracles every day from helping me through things, to letting me know He is there by responding to my prayers and being by my side no matter what. In the past year, he has put someone in my life that throughout all of the hard and struggling times financially, they are there. If it weren't for God putting this friend of mine in my life, I may look like a happy person, but on the inside; my life would be a living hell. I don't think that I would have the strength that I do now. Since he has put this person in my life, my life has been more worth living. 
If it wasn't for his grace and help; I would not be strong enough to live and get through all of the turmoil that my family and I have faced in the past year. We were hit hard by the recession and it hurt my family when all we needed was his support. During this, we were brought down to our knees but he was there to support and help us. He shows me much of his love by always being there when I need him. He is never away when I need to talk no matter the situation.
Throughout my life, God has made me the person I am and will continue to help me to be all that I can. He helps me through anything and everything no matter the circumstances and he helps me to believe in everyday miracles. He is the reason that I live and he is the ultimate motive to be who I want to be.

In August 2009 I lost my mother in a car accident. When the priest told me she was gone that's when I realized how much I really loved her, and how much I really needed her in my life. I realized that she was not the perfect mother, but she was my mother and now she is gone.
As the oldest of three, I always kept to myself and dealt with my problems on my own. I was the type of person that had to learn from my own mistakes. I didn't listen to anyone and always had to have the last word. This brought a lot of problems between my mom and me. It got to the point that we were no longer friends; we became enemies.
As time went by I started to judge my mom. I didn't see her as a good mother. I always pointed out her mistakes, always telling her that I was a better mother than she was, and even went as far as telling her that for me she was not my mother. Those words brought tears to her eyes, but for some reason I didn't care. To my kids she was great; sometimes I asked her why hadn't she been like that with us? She would only look at me and smile.  Everything she did made me the person I am today. When I finally matured enough to understand and see that everything she did had a reason, I lost her.
In a year she was not only my mother she had become one of my best friends. But I never told her that. I never told her how sorry I was for not understanding her parenting skills. I never asked for forgiveness for all the tears I made her cry. I believe we all go through life taking things for granted, not realizing how much a person really means to us until he or she is gone. 
I was not the perfect child but I wanted the perfect mother. Now that she is gone I realize she was the perfect mother; she was my mother. She was the only person that would hear me and not judge me. She was my only true and unconditional love. She was the only one that would have my back when everyone else was against me. Now that she is gone I realize how much I truly need her.
In losing my mom I didn't only lose a mother I lost a true friend and the best love of all. Losing her last year in that car accident made me a true believer in that old saying "" You don't know what you got til it's gone"". I believe in it with all my heart, I guess I had to live it to believe it.

What if everyone had to encourage their self and do everything alone? That would be terribly wrong.  Everyone needs good support and people behind them to be successful in anything.  
I realized this when I swam the mile for the first time. Before this I was nervous, jumpy, excited, and not sure what to expect. It was at the pool at Mountain View High School that I would be doing one of the biggest things in my life.
Coach Ryan, my parents, my friends Jayden and Ashlyn, and me would all have something to do with my success. When Ryan first told the team about having everyone in Platinum Group swim the mile, I was on his side because I thought it was great idea. It wasn't until a few days later that I realized that he had said a mile. Not a 500 or even a thousand, but a mile. One-thousand- six-hundred-fifty yards.  Sixty six laps of back and forth, back and forth. Wall to wall again and again, focusing not on being tired, but staying over the black cross in the center of the lane. Ryan was cheering, my parents were cheering, and Jayden and Ashlyn were cheering. Ryan had prepared me for this. He believed I could do it. My parents, Dad timing and Mom counting, believed I could do it. Jayden and Ashlyn believed I could do it. I thought I could, but I wasn't 100% sure.
When the race was over, I saw everybody cheering for me. When I got out of the water, everybody was congratulating me. 
 I had met my goal and swam a mile in under twenty five minutes. I couldn't have had success in this goal unless I had all these people supporting, and in a way swimming with me, and cheering me on. 
Everyone needs encouragement and others to believe in them, or else no one will succeed in anything. I would go on and do the same for Ashlyn, like I did Jayden while she swam her mile. This I believe.

078356.txt,Ben,,Under 18,"Piedmont, California","March 7, 2010",2010,I believe in ski boots,sports,"I believe in ski boots. Rather, putting on ski boots.
 Donning ski boots is the most painful experience I have ever subjected myself to. Maybe it is the shape of my foot or my innate incapability at dealing with uncomfortable footwear but the process of putting on those hard, tight, plastic traps has haunted me every winter since age five.
Maybe more of a preference is needed. I love skiing. Despite my lack of skill or toleration of the cold, I adore the snow's thrill. But before I can sail over expansive seas of snow, I must first manage to force my feet into a pair of ski boots. This is not an easy task. First, I find a warm place to sit down, like a couch in a ski- lodge or the seat of a heated car. Then I take one of my ski boots, open all the buckles, and pull the lip down as far as it will go. I pull my foot out of my warm shoe and cram it into the mouth of the boot, scrunching my toes as close together as possible. The end of my foot is crushed and bent, yet won't budge any further. Pushing my heel with the palm of my hand, I slowly start to make progress into the boot.  A sharp pain which travels to every part of my body emanates from a spot in my foot where two bones touch. The world is covered up by total agony. Constrained and short of breath, I consider pulling out. Instead, I position both hands and push as hard as I can in one last desperate attempt. My foot is crushed to a pulp, yet stubborn as a rock. Then, unexpectantly, it pops into place. My toes, which had previously lost circulation, begin to regain consciousness. My muscles relaxing, I return to life. Suddenly, I remember the second boot waiting for me. My breathing, previously slow, begins to speed up. Yet despite my vivid memories of its companion, I still put on the second boot because I know that a day of flying from the highest mountaintops is worth the pain. How could I put the boot aside, giving up after I had come so far? How could I abandon the summit simply because of pain at the base? I believe in putting on the second boot, because the pain is always well spent. 
At some point, everything seems like a ski boot. I have endured late nights and red eyes caused by an English paper and weeks of stressed caused by a bad grade. Yet whenever I begin to suspect that a particular assignment is not worth the score, I remember that it is of no significance when compared to mountain ahead. I felt the same way pressing buttons for an online driving course at three twenty in the morning: that the result of my labor would be well worth the discomfiture. It was- by five in the morning I was done with the course forever. Maybe all of life is like a ski-boot; maybe the only thing that pushes us onward is the dream of something better.

078867.txt,Brandi,,Under 18,"Boise, Idaho","March 17, 2010",2010,I Believe,values & spirituality,"I believe in the imaginable things. I believe in the words, in the facial expressions and the body language; things that tell a lot about a person just by looking. Words can have powerful meaning; expressions are clues to what the person may be thinking at that moment and time. A simple thing like raising an eye brow shows confusion or interest, squinting of the eyes may show jealousy, firm lips and a clenched jaw resembles anger or frustration. I also believe in the more tangible things; that the more fortunate should hold the desire to give a hand, so that the less fortunate's desires may be received. People take what they have for granted. Anything and everything they have is not enough. I believe the culture we live in is perceived as one that wants and wants and won't stop till its achieved. Greedy people, selfish people, uncaring people, consume the majority of the population in the culture. If only the emotions and actions that are less tangible, like the 'imaginable' theories were as important as these 'things' or 'items' this culture must posses. The culture likes what is easy. Things that are easy are cheating, lying, stealing, and manipulating. If the majority of the culture was compassionate, unselfish, and hardworking and welcomed any opportunity to give, the world would be a much more content place. The things that are possessed are taken for granted, things we should be thankful for instead of wanting more and more. This culture is the most auspicious. I believe that every drop of water is precious for people in third world countries, for they may live without such preciousness. I believe in the significance of understanding the importances of our past, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" (FDR) To me this is saying the only thing we could end up doing is what we've done in the past. I believe in some circumstances that people can learn from their mistakes; indeed, human beings make mistakes, but it is their strength and self will power to be able to make sure they don't re-make those mistakes. Inauguration of new things, these things never experienced before can lead us to contain such emotion that leaves us feeling uneasy. When anguish is presented, it is at some complacency to demand returning to what is most familiar. Change can seem polar, either pleasing and gratifying, or poor and inadequate. Learning from the past can nearly provide an asylum for what change may or may not arise in the future. I believe in an unpredictable future, an unpredictable life. What lessons of life could be taken or attained from life itself if there was the way of knowing what was going to take place before it happened? Life is merely unexpected, ever fluctuating with the alteration within itself. I believe in the domino effect. I believe in people having the choice.

something greater than life itself. I believe that death itself is not an ending; it is a

""Everyone dies, but not everyone lives."" That's what Pastor Monty stated as we
began our plans for the funeral. My dad lived his life based upon this quote. That's ""who""
my dad was! With just the brief encounters Pastor Monty had with him, he knew my dad
was one who always lived everyday to the fullest. My dad ""lived life,"" for him everyday
was special. Everyday was something new and exciting. He knew he would not be young
forever and he knew how to get the most out of what he had left.
My dad Brian passed away two years ago. My dad was 5 ft 10 inches tall and 200
pounds. He loved being outdoors, fishing and hunting, but most of all he loved
motorcycles. He loved the feeling and the adrenaline rush he got from throwing his leg
over that bike, but out of all the things that bike did for him he loved that him and my
sister shared this passion together. He and my sister went to a race together like they did
every weekend but for some reason that I will never know this weekend was different.
While my mom and I were shopping we got a call that changed my family's life forever.
My sister called and said my dad crashed…
Sometimes it is ironic to think that my dad died doing the thing he loved most. I
know he had a smile on his face going over that last jump before he crashed and I
believe he lived every last minute down to the second of his life doing what he loved. He
passed away when I was 14 years old, I wish he could have stayed in my life longer but it
was enough time to teach me the meaning of life and that you need to live it.
He was the one who always taught me to believe this. Ill always miss my dad no

to teach me many life lessons and make me a better person today. This is why every

079212.txt,danielle,,Under 18,"piedmont, California","March 30, 2010",2010,love is a highway,love,"I believe that love is a highway and makes us blind to other people's imperfections and so we should take things slow.   I believe that when people are traveling down the fast paced highway of love they are prone to miss imperfections that their lover may possess because they rushing into things. We jump into relationships, desperately try to make them work, and complain after they don't work out. The complaining after they don't work out is inevitable because we then realize that we were not actually in love but that wewere infatuated with the person and now that the relationship is over we see the piles and piles of imperfections that are held by the other person.
I began to believe in this after watching my friends break up with their boyfriends, consoling them after things ended horribly, and pointing out all of the exes flaws. For months and months they would tell me that they loved him, he was the one, and he was the greatest, but after they broke up, they hated him, he wasn't close to being the one, and he was the worst. I always asked myself why my friends dated these guys for so long without seeing the imperfections when they would constantly hang out, text, and go on dates. I saw the imperfections but it was as if my friends were blind. Suddenly it hit me. When you think you love someone and things are moving quickly you are prone to miss out on the other persons imperfections and signs that you should end things just like when you are speeding on the highway and you miss the brake lights of cars ahead of you telling you to slow down and when you miss your exit because you were carelessly flying by.
This led me to believe that we must take things slow that we do not miss out on key signs that really would show us if we are in love with a person and we must be able to identify their imperfections because loving someone who has imperfections but is perfect for you is very different than just ignoring their imperfections all together until you realize that you cannot love the person forever.

Some of them may be as follows: there are consequences to everything you do that may affect those around you, it is not wise to procrastinate, or how about, be careful of what you ask for because you just might get it. There are consequences to everything you do that may affect those around you as well. I have learned that if you don't practice then you will surely forget, (practice makes perfect). For example, I didn't make the most out of my time during summer break to study French. As a result, I went into French two and forgot everything that I was taught and I had to switch out of the class. I have learned that it is not wise to procrastinate because by doing so could result in not only a bad grade, but aslso shody work and poor effort. For example, I procrastinated with a science paper before and because I procrastinated with the paper, not only was the format messed up but to my surprise, I found out that the printer didn't work and as if that wasn'i bad enough, as I was saving my work to my email, the computer automatically shut down and I had to start the paper over for a second time. Yes, I was heated but that's the price I paid for waiting to start my paper at the last minute. Also another good life lesson that I have learned is to be carefull of what you ask for because you just might get it (not literally). Sometimes we don't have to alaways ask because sometimes we often tend to speak by our actions. For example, whenever I decide to make a bad choice or a good choice, I send the message to others that I am ready for the consequences. Though that is not always the case, my actions speak louder than my words at times. I believe that people should learn from their mistakes, some such as, there are consequences to everything you do, you shouldn't procrastinate, and be carefull of what you ask for because you just might get it.

I was blessed to meet a great man in 2005.  Even though I was only 17 years old, I felt as if I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.  Everything was great until he was called to go serve in South Korea.  We kept in touch for about 3 months but we eventually lost touch.  I moved on with my life and so did he.  I thought about him every now and then but I had already convinced myself that I was never going to see him again.  Numbers change, people move.  This past July, while I was in Florida, I ran into him.  I hadn't seen him for 4 years.  After all those years, I still felt that feeling when being in his presence.  We exchanged numbers and again we went our separate ways.  I respected his relationship and he respected mine.  ""They say if you love someone let them go, and if they come back it means so much more.""  I received a call from him in October.  I got engaged in December. We are getting married in September.  
Even though I had a hard time letting go of him in 2005, I moved on with my life. I let life take its course and didn't interrupt destiny.  During the years we were apart, I learned a lot in my other relationships.  I believe that if we had stayed together, it would not have lasted. I believe we were separated because we needed room to grow. We are now both mature and able to handle obstacles that may come in our way. Being in Love with someone is a wonderful feeling and I am blessed to have found someone to share it with. I believe that when two people are in love with each other, they will overcome against all odds. I believe the power of love works in mysterious ways and to achieve it, we are willing to climb the highest mountain and swim the deepest ocean. I wasn't looking for love; however it came back to me.

""You don't know what you have before you lose it.""  Think of your siblings, sometimes you want to kill them, other time you want to rip their head off.  But when you think of them dying or getting hurt all you want to do is hold them close and tight and protect them.  A little over a year ago, my 8 year old little sister was diagnosed with follicular variant papillary carcinoma, more commonly known as thyroid cancer.  She has a needle biopsy done, 2 surgeries on her thyroid, multiple CAT scans, and she had to undergo radiation chemotherapy.  
This was the hardest thing my family has ever had to go though.  Its been a little over a year and my sister to this day doesn't know she had cancer.  She just knows she was sick.  When faced with cancer of some other chronic illness, you look at the same sibling you wanted to kill a few days ago, but now all you want to do is protect them.  How do you protect against something you know nothing about?  How do you stay sane when the doctors tell you things you don't understand?  What do you say when you little sister asks you, ""Am I dying?""
My family grew a lot closer since this experience; we've learned to appreciate each other.  We love each other more; we listen, care and no longer want to rip each other's heads off.  We are very fortunate we learned to appreciate each other, and that my little sister is all better now.  
I believe everyone should take a moment to tell their parents and siblings we love them, especially when we're mad, or annoyed.  I believe we need to cherish one another, because we wont have the people we love forever, and we'll regret not telling them.

Although there may be wonderful things that have come out of today's mass media, most of it is targeted specifically towards the youth of today and persuades people like me into buying their product or liking their song, movie, etc. 
It's all too common for teenagers to become similar in their tastes in music, clothing, movies, and any other media. This is because most media is targeted toward teenagers, who just won't accept the idea of consumerism. They won't accept the fact that they are buying into a bunch of crap. As a nation, being a consumer is part of daily life. It's also human nature to want to fit in, so we mediate towards popular choice. But the popular choice didn't come into play by accident. 
Around the age of 7 or 8 I had gotten brainwashed by musical artists such as Britney Spears and The Backstreet Boys. Britney Spears was one of my favorite singers, and although she has made a comeback it is still a little embarrassing to reminisce about the moments when I knew her songs word for word. I can hardly remember the lyrics to one of her songs now. What I do remember is the provocative music videos that I was seeing at such a young age. The topics of the songs I listened to influenced the way I saw myself. As music today becomes more and more similar I have chosen to regress into the 80's, 70's, and 60's for my musical inspiration. 
My little sisters, who are at the age of 9 and 15, have to grow up with musical artists such as Lady Gaga and Kesha whose lyrical concepts seem to make them think it's alright to talk about promiscuous topics that should not be made public. It's hard for me to sit back and watch them, around the age of puberty, be brainwashed by these ideas that will stick with them forever. They feel they have to be simple minded, flirty all the time, and wear the same clothes as Miley Cyrus (who has her own clothing line) just to impress boys. Just to give you an idea, if you have no clue what today's teenagers are listening to, here are some lyrics to one of Kesha's songs, Blah, Blah, Blah:
I don't really care where you live at
Just turn around, boy, let me hit that
Don't be a little —– with your chit chat
Just show me where your —-'s at.
Sex has always sold and the record companies know this. These types of lyrics are used to make a quick buck. Individualism is absent with today's artists. This has happened to every generation, but I think it has to stop somewhere. The media has to stop brainwashing the youth and encourage increased artist creativity.

The day I met Bisharro, she had spread before her all the paperwork one would need to begin a child care business.  She had her child care named, she had her parent contracts, she even had two families signed up, she had her policies and procedures bound and finalized.  She was ready to go, but lacked a place to do her child care in.  She asked me to help her.  She could not get any realtors or landlords to return her calls. I started researching homes that afternoon.  I got addresses and phone numbers, called realtors and private home owners, always asking up front if they would allow licensed child care to take place in their rental home.  A broker in the area proclaimed that he had no problem with that.  Then he added ""Anyone who does have a problem with that does not have their houses up to code – all of mine are up to code and you can choose from any of them"".  ""Tell me"", he asked ""does anyone else need a rental home to do licensed child care in?""  ""Well"", I answered ""I believe there could be"".  ""This sounds fantastic"" he said.  So I looked at two rentals, the realtor even offered to fence in the backyard at no cost.  All was great, until they met my client.  The realtor had forgotten to bring a Rental Application, but assured us she would email one.  When the realtor wouldn't answer my client's phone calls or reply to her emails, I phoned and emailed.  No responses until finally a couple weeks later the realtor called stating ""we decided we just didn't want to have licensed child care in that home after all"".  ""Oh"", I asked, ""how about the other rental homes in the area?""  The realtor replied ""we don't own any other rentals"".  That was last September.  Bisharro continues in her search.  She can tell by looking at a phone number whether that person will even return her call or not.  We drive through neighborhoods, take down numbers, go through the papers, and meet with realtors.  We are friends.  She has taught me about perseverance in the eyes of adversity and I have walked with her and it has helped me understand.  Our power has grown for two have become one in purpose.  It is through this story that
I believe  a special person of ""one"" can provide hope for another.
Leadership is not about power.
Leadership is about serving.
Thru hope a person may realize the strengths they hold within themselves which connects and inspires others to be leaders;  and they will learn:

And right after she'd say that, I'd get a lot of hope and normally everything got better. Just like she said it would.

079969.txt,Scott,,,"Jasper, Indiana","April 16, 2010",2010,This Old Table,family,"This old, oak table brings with it good ghosts.
I am its inheritor. For more decades than I am old, this table graced my grandparents' kitchen until Grandma Toni died at 92. 
True to its age, the table sags a bit in the center and is pirate-ship creaky under the weight of shifted elbows. As far as monetary value, think Goodwill. Guests will find nothing pretty about my table. It is pocked and cracked and gashed and chipped, and its leaf does not completely match, as if it was meant to elongate a different table. Guests will not recognize the inner beauty it possesses; fond memories bloom from it like an eternal bouquet.
I recall my grandfather saying grace at the head of this table, the patriarch's position, his sitting always signaling the start of Sunday dinners shared. 
I recall my grandmother sitting across from me. The table served as a battlefield during our Scrabble wars, until the letter tiles became too tricky to maneuver with her uncooperative, aged fingers. 
I recall Uncle Dave laughing while reading Funky Winkerbean, the Evansville Courier's comics spread before him on the tabletop. Despite the disease that dogged Dave during most of his 36 years, he was the most good-humored of us all. 
The table was a second-hand table when my grandparents got it in the early 1950s. It remained in their kitchen until 2010 when my father and I loaded it upside-down into his GMC pickup. 
Now in my home, this table instills a daily sense of southern Indiana family, reminding me of living uncles, aunts and cousins galore drawn to this table for holiday meals and weekly Sunday dinners; for card games with their one-dollar bets and beer; for conversations shared while drinking coffee and cooing babies in bouncy seats placed atop it—the river-town gossip bouncing between the women came as natural to the table as its wood grain.
The table's fresh presence in my home forewarns that we are becoming a family scattered. Grandma Toni was our blood magnet. Her house, our central hub, possessed a gravitational pull essential to the big family gathering. Her house, built by my grandfather in the 1940s, is empty, its contents scattered among scattered family. A for-sale sign is in her yard. We are now a family that will likely gather in meaningful quantities only during weddings and funerals.
So here I sit, tapping at these laptop keys to the beat of my table's heartwood, channeling a spirit trio comprised of my grandfather, grandmother and uncle. I'm happy to host these beloved ghosts, despite the lump in my throat. 
I think too about my living relatives. While we will not collectively meet up as much as before, each family member remains a part of this table's grain. I never know who might pay a visit when I sit here. 
I am a proud, new owner of an important, old table. 
I believe in this table, and the family that returns.

I am also a firm believer you can adapt other teachings in your life and still believe in God and the Christian faith.
As a child I often question Christianity partially because of the activities going on within the black churches especially mines. I remember sitting in Christ Community Baptist Church watching a women doing the robot as others shouted and it always seemed the pastor was yelling at the church members. When I would leave church I remember hearing members gossip about each other I thought to myself God would not like this. I kept my feelings to myself because you never dare mention thoughts like that to my Grandmother. My grandmother was a very religious woman; she made me go to church with her every Sunday. 
As I got older I started to realize that people often let religion and the governments dictate their lives. People are often too scared to go find truth and are content with not knowing anything. I came across The Five Percent Network break down the population according to what people know. Their teachings were refreshing to me because it answered my question about a lot of things and many of their beliefs were personal beliefs of mine. The Five Percent Network ""sees the world population divided into three groups: 85% of the people are blind to the knowledge of themselves and God, while 10% of the people know the truth but teach a lie for their personal gain; seen as part of this 10% are religious leaders that teach that God is an incorporeal God being (hence the term ""mystery God""). The 10% also includes the governments and corporations of the world that deceive and mislead the majority of the world through most of the available media outlets. The remaining 5% are the poor righteous teachers"" (Wikipedia). 
Often times I believe people let religion, politics, and the government dictate their way of life. What led me to the Five Percent Network is their quest to find truth and uplift the black community. There way of life can sometime be complex to understand it leads me to do further research and strengthen my mind. It is time people start finding their own voices and come up with their own opinions on life. I am a firm believer in God, I pray at night, ask for forgiveness, and try to live my life as best as I can. It is said God is a ""selfish God"" but I find other religions and The Five Percent Network have beliefs I can put into my everyday life. Even though it is a hard task to follow I believe people need to stop letting society brainwash their minds and come up with their own way of lives. The truth is out there it is time we go find it.

080170.txt,Shalisse,,,"Farmington, Utah","April 21, 2010",2010,I Believe In the Power of Choice,courage;disability;self-determination,"I believe in choice. It is a word we often use, an everyday action for us all. I want to share my belief in the power of choice. The effects that we are accountable only after the action of choice. We choose to respond to surroundings. I have found simple acts of a basic choice is what creates our reality. Sometimes, this results in inspirational hope or even superhuman inspiring stories of people doing the impossible.
      Little choices give so much power. Our ability to create is such a miracle. We do not need money or influence or accreditations to create something meaningful, deep with substance and peaceful beauty… not really. We create by choice. 
     Talents, backgrounds, abilities and even limiting resources available have never held back humanity in creating by deliberate decisions to choose to mold, creatively solve and shape our lives. Beauty can be found in almost everything if we decide to see it and nurture it. Attitude, motivation, spirituality, great works of art, even the founding concepts of liberty and freedom that Americans hold so dear were born under the most desperately meager circumstances. Often adverse obstacles placed before us can and do become the strength we can receive if only we choose to make it so.
      In history we see it countless times. I am privileged to witness it first hand everyday. I have a Mother whose strength and power had come from her ability to help others. She was the one who had the answers, serving the community. She created peace and beauty with the simple touch of her hands. The strength of her abilities seeming to circle around her innate ability in the arts, music and style. Her service to others was unmatched. This was my childhood mother. Her choices were always to see, help and do. 
     Sadly, as life often does, the flow of life was interrupted by opposition and difficulty. In my Mothers case an eye disease, Retinitis Pigmentosa. It is unpredictable and incurable. This was an obvious devastation and has taken its toll on this once so agile and capable woman whose touch and service blessed so many. For years she has struggled with a place to fit and a way to rebuild. She has not been able to create the world around her the way she had magnificently done before. 
     The last year something changed. Slow at first, she focused on changing her choices. She began to create. I have witnessed this mighty change. She is interconnecting with others on a level above anything I have seen. Her compassion is contagiously electrifying to all around her. The worth of her being, the worth she inspires others to have is fulfilling. She is creating a peaceful completeness against all odds. This was and is her choice. She is radiant once again. I BELIEVE IN CHOICE. It is the key to creating life, our life, our power, with God's help our choice is our strength, our worth and divine nature.

080850.txt,Jardinay,,,"Jacksonville, Florida","May 3, 2010",2010,Mother Knows Best,family;self-knowledge,"Throughout my life, I've always heard the statement: ""Mother knows best."" In the younger years of my life, all the correct advice my mother would give me would go in one ear, and come out the other.  I wasn't trying to hear what she had to say. Every time I made mistakes, or the wrong decisions my mom would have advice. At that time and age it wasn't the type of advice I wanted to hear. A lot of the times I was just thinking she was trying to be mean too me, or nag me. As I've grown older I realize that my mother's advice was for the better. I've been through many situations in life, in which I didn't take my mother's advice, when I really should have. For instance, throughout my high school years, my mother always told me ""Don't have any kids until you finish high school and college if you are going.""  Well that was one of the times she gave me good advice, and of course I didn't listen. In the year of 2006 I became pregnant, that was after I finished high school, and before I could finish college. It took for me to have my baby and get into college to realize that I should have taken my mother's advice. Now things are much harder than if I would have finished college, and then had a child. Now I see the reason why I should have finished college, before I had a child. After my two years are up at my community college, I would have liked to transfer to a university in Atlanta or California. Now I really have to think about it. It would be hard because I have a child, and if I go anywhere out of Jacksonville, I won't have anyone to help me with her. This is why my mother told me to wait. Now I have to deal with it. If I would have taken mother's advice, things would not have been this hard.  Now I find myself calling my mom for advice when needed. Everything she tells me I listen to her rather I agree or not. I realize that no one will lead or guide me in the right direction, with the right advice like my mother would! ""Mother Knows Best"" This I believe!

080909.txt,Sylvia,,Under 18,"St.louis, Missouri","May 3, 2010",2010,The Balanced Mind and Body,self-determination;sports,"I sat talking to one of my distant relatives that I had only learned today, from difficult strand of being a third cousin of my uncle twice removed, that we were related.  They began to ask the basic questions you ask a twelve year old, what school are you attending, what's your favorite subject, what sports do you play? For this question my answer is long, it contains many different sports. As I went down this list my so called ""distant relative"" asked me ""Why so many? Isn't it hard to find time for your studies""? I stopped to think about this question though they only intended the question to be light, easy to answer. It might be partly true that time is harder to find that I could use to work on projects or studying. But I know deep in my heart that I would never give up playing sports, because they are a large part of my life, and who I am.
I strongly believe in the theory that a sound mind and a sound body go hand and hand. From a technical point, sports are something that all people should be involved with, it is an easy and quick way to get going and get your heart pumping. If a person builds the routine of exercising regularly in their early years, then the chances of that person keeping up a healthy life style goes way up.
 I believe that digging deeper into the benefits of participating in sports shows many benefits on a person's attitude and valuable life skills. Confidence, determination, team work skills, commitment, the ability to trust and believe in others, these are all skills that are obtained from playing sports on a team. When you step on a field whether it be for soccer, lacrosse, or volleyball, once you are on that field you are no longer an individual. You no longer stand alone, apart from your other teammates on the field. This might seem like something a person might not want, to be just like all the others, to not have any special quality setting you apart. This is only temporary though, with the team that you are representing, you have chosen, you will fight for them, do your best, and your fait on the field will be decided together. With that team you will feel the bitterness of defeat that will determine you to work harder and obtain what you have been fighting for all season, and you desire more than anything, victory. 
People that do not participate in sports, in general, are not able to understand how much playing them can benefit you. I believe that sports are great, and can bring you a unique feeling when you are playing them. Everybody should give it a go at some point in their life. I believe that life is a climb, but all the skills sports can help you acquire, can help you become one step closer to the top.

080918.txt,Lindsay,,,"Gilbert, Arizona","May 3, 2010",2010,I thought I was one of those lucky princesses,self-determination;self-knowledge,"I use to believe that the sun could never shine for me. That life was stuck one way with no hopes of escaping the endless downward spiral. That in the end, no one would remember me because I was a tiny speck in the grand scheme of life. This is what I thought before I knew there was green grass just outside my door.
Let me take you back to the time were all my dreams and hopes did not exist. I use to believe that there were no happy endings or perfect romances. That Disney had lied to all little girls about being rescued from the perils in life. During those darker days when I was stuck on the top floor of my castle, I would lie in bed wishing something or someone could end it all. My castle was located deep in the black forest through rough terrains with hidden beasts that would eat you whole. If anyone approached it they would just turn around on their white horse and forget that there was someone who needed to be saved. Frozen tears stuck to my eyes blinding me so I could not see that I could escape. Little fairies would whisper sweet sorrows in my ears telling me I should give up all hope. I had almost given up all hope too.
Then one day I awoke to a small knock upon my door. Thinking it to be the awful ugly witch that locked me away in the forgotten castle I walked over to answer the door. You could say I was a little surprise that when I opened the door I found no one standing there. I had never even thought to opening the door and trying to leave myself. It was one of those forbidden things a princess locked away is never suppose to do. Girls locked away are supposed to wait forever until the day their prince charming comes in valiantly yelling ""I have come to save you my princess!"" I am not going to lie, that would have been amazing to see a man on a white horse come and save me, but that is not what I really wanted. I wanted to be able to save myself from this black castle. 
So when I opened my door and walked out of my room, I noticed that I was not stuck in a castle. Right outside my door were fields of green with wild flowers sprouting everywhere. In the distance there were people smiling and playing games and yelling for me join them. The happiness I had forgotten was out there, just within my reach. I had to choose now, to turn back to my black castle to the place and feelings that I knew so well, or to discover how it really feels to be happy; a feeling that I could not remember.  Not everyone can expect to be saved from the all hardships in life like princess locked away. The only girls I know who have been saved like this are not even real people.
I believe if you wish for it with ever fiber of your being and actually make an effort, you can save yourself. I was able to, so I know it is not an impossible thing for others to do. Not everyone can be one of those lucky princesses, but if we try hard enough we can all find our happy endings.

081227.txt,Anthony,,,"St. Louis, Missouri","May 5, 2010",2010,This I believe: Leadership,education & knowledge,"When I think of this essay I can't get away from the words that Whitney Houston sang once- ""I believe that the children are the future!"" I feel as if that was a very powerful statement, especially when it comes to the area of leadership, after all it will be the children who grow into the leaders of tomorrow, and if we, as the leaders of today, fail to hone them into the best that they can be, then we truly do our future leaders a dis-service. I was once told that no one ever really wants to be the leader, because at the end of the day that person is the one that is the most responsible! I eventually learned what they meant by that statement, but I also learned that I would not have it any other way.
The term leadership is often thrown around loosely. Leadership is sometimes thought of by some as a god given right, talent, or by others as just naturally intuitive. I feel that for one to become a leader one must first be led! Leadership is knowing when to be assertive and when to be passive to others ideas. A good leader takes into account every follower suggestions, skills, and abilities! Just being a good dictator is not, in my opinion being a good leader! One must be willing to accept that that people around them may just as well be able to solve a problem related to a task just as simply as the leader could. A leader never stops learning. In my opinion a leader has a desire to know as much as possible about any and every thing around him. A leader is always willing to help uplift his followers for the greater good of the entire organization, and never put their own wants in front. A leader is always willing to go bat for his team in an effort to save the game. 
In my experience as a leader I even sometimes found myself to become the follower. At first it was a little confusing, I would think to myself, ""Wait a minute! Who's in charge here?"" I quickly found out that I was not ""in charge"" in this particular situation at all, even though I carried the title as the leader. The subordinate had the best plan of action and execution. I was lucky! 
In conclusion, we all have the power to become the leader of something. All we have to do is pay attention to our own strengths and the lessons that the leaders before us have given. I urge us all to open our eyes and provide good examples for the leaders of the future.

081324.txt,Ciarra,,Under 18,"Kernersville, North Carolina","May 6, 2010",2010,No One Can Live The American Dream,self-knowledge,"Florence King once said ""People are so busy dreaming the American Dream, fantasizing about what they could be or have a right to be, that they're all asleep at the switch. Consequently we are living in the Age of Human Error.""
There comes a point in time when we all say we're going to have or be what we've always aspired. For instance becoming a wealthy millionaire someday who ever existed, having an occupation we've always wanted from childhood. This I believe no one can live the American Dream. 
I remember saying to my parents years ago my first job was going to be at Chick-fil-A by the age of 16, here I am 17 years old today working at Mayberry Ice Cream and Sandwich Shoppe. Having this job is not a bad thing because a job is a job…but the job I wanted I wasn't able to get when I was 16 years old. This was the American Dream that I believe no one can live.
Teachers motivate students to go to college to get a good degree. Teachers claim they don't make a good salary although they have a teaching degree. My question is…Why be a teacher, is it because of the goal you tried to reach didn't get accomplished as a high school graduate? This I believe no one can live the American Dream.  
As a young teenage African American girl I've always wanted to major in Criminal Justice, its not that I don't believe I have the potential its just that I'm afraid of what life in the future may bring. Will I become a nurse, secretary, waitress etc…? No one knows including me. This I believe no one can live the American Dream.
You look at me and say I'm successful and will turn out to be something major in life…because of my grades and extracurricular activities, but in my head I'm saying this is the American Dream that no one can live.
In this weary world you will find no perfect soul. There comes a point in everyone's life when we all mess up. Being perfect is not an option can you guess why? I can answer… It's because no one can live the American Dream.   
You can strive as hard as you would like but to me it still remains the same…No one can live the American Dream and this is what I believe.

Never let someone or something take you away from what you want. In my personal life I've witnessed friends and family dreaming big, and their dreams lead to big successes. I believe that when you have hope, nothing will stop you from dreaming and becoming what you want.
Adriana, my 23- year- old friend, always dreamed of becoming a nurse but thought that she would never become one. Even though she tried and tried, she always failed, but she continued saying, ""try and fail, but not fail to try."" Adriana always had her hopes up. Then I witnessed something in her life; what she wanted to become she became. Now she is a great nurse and she has a great career. Each day she risks her life, but she never lets herself be discouraged. I see her living the quote ""keep your heart open to dreams, for as long as there's a dream, there is hope, and as long as there's hope there is joy in living.""
I also witnessed my father, who did not think his dreams would ever come true. Even though his dreams looked very unrealistic, he believed that ""You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream."" My father did not realize that one day he would become a mayor in the Colombian town where I grew up. As a matter of fact, his dreams became real. My father became the mayor of Filandia, and he tried to do his best to make that town better. In 1996 when he became mayor, he was really stressed, but he was happy that he was doing something good for the town. In 2000, when my dad retired, he said ""This path is hard, but I never gave up even though it was tough."" I believe that people should never give up on their dream, because a big dream leads to big things, and as an anonymous writer put it, ""Dreams are today's answers to tomorrow's questions."" 
I believe everyone should dream because dreams give people hope, even when situations are tough. Always dream big because you will achieve great things and get far in life. Even though I am still in high school, I have a big dream of becoming a doctor, and I know I can reach it someday. I have my hopes up no matter what, because I believe ""The only thing that will stop you from fulfilling your dreams is you."" My advice is to not let anyone, including yourself, stop you from succeeding in life. This I believe.

081971.txt,Will,,Under 18,"Trussville, Alabama","May 17, 2010",2010,Live Your Life,values & spirituality,"What does it mean for one to have true happiness? Some may point to material items such as a car or their house or what kind of clothes they may have on – but then again we have all been told ""Money doesn't buy happiness."" Some may point to their families and loved ones saying happiness revolves around who they associate themselves with. Yes, spending time with those we love can affect how happy we are at a given moment, but does that truly define happiness?
 Merriam-Webster defines happiness as ""a state of well being and contentment."" To be content.  That's what happiness is to me. It's to lie in bed at night and to know I have made the most of my life, to know I haven't taken a second for granted and to believe that I have made the most of the situations I have faced. To live happily is to not look back and to think of what I could have done differently to change something, or to look back and wish I could have let someone know I felt about them. To be content and at peace with myself defines happiness to me. All too often we look back on mistakes we have made and dwell on the past. When we do this we allow everything to consume us in a negative manner and we fail to see the good in ourselves and the positive things we have to live for. We need to have some clarity and make a choice to be happy, to live our lives.
Each and every day we have to live is another gift. It's another chance to better the world around us and to better ourselves. Each day brings a new beginning, a fresh start to put the past behind us and to look at what the world has in store for us. We need to enjoy the little things in life, like spending time with those you love and letting them know you love them. Find time to slowdown and avoid being caught up in the rush of everything. Devote some time in your day to day life to stop and think and maybe even say a prayer. Sometimes a little break or feeling of comfort is all you need to get through a tough time or even brighten up a typical day. 
Life doesn't always come made to order, it doesn't ever happen like you plan it out in your head. But hey, who am I to tell anyone about life? I'm just a seventeen year old kid who doesn't have all the experience, but I always try to keep an open mind and a good head on my shoulders. Your life is what you choose to make it. When you wake up in the morning, live that day for what it's worth. Don't look forward and don't look back. Each day is a chance to make the world a better place. Have the will to share the joy in your life and to be content, knowing what it means to have happiness. It is there for each and every one of us.

Now you might regret doing what you did. I think that you shouldn't regret whatever it is that you do; I believe that the decisions you made make you who you are now. I strongly believe this because I have made so many bad decisions in the past and am most likely going to make some more in the future. Not all decisions that you make are going to seem right in the beginning, but it does make you a better person one way or another.
When I was 16 going on 17, I was in Gage Park High. I use to be with the gangbangers thinking I was tough and untouchable. I was drinking, smoking, and I guess you could say I was running wild. I ditched school so many times just to be with my boyfriend and so call friends. I stopped going to school for a year. I was still enrolled but I just didn't go. In the classes I would go I would feel really lost. When I was in class I could do the work would get good grades on my assignments, but that really didn't make a difference if I wasn't going as often. I felt really dumb because I knew if I went to school more often and actually stood in school I would know what was going on in my classes. I am smart, but I made a lot of dumb stupid decisions. My teachers would tell me the same thing. Which made me feel bad cause the people around me was thinking I was a lost cost.
When I lost my best friend that really opened my eyes. It hurts because the same stupid decisions I was making he made also. He's gone now and he can't do anything about it, but I can and I did. I am not affiliated with the bangers anymore. My mom transferred me out that school and put to into an alternative school. I am doing a lot better in school.  I get good grades and I'm graduating November 2010. I don't regret what I did because I learned from my mistakes. The decisions I made in the past turned out to be the right ones for me in the future. This is why I believe in No Regrets.

083148.txt,Skye,,,"Palm Desert, California","June 3, 2010",2010,We Need Directions,self-knowledge,"I believe in directions. I believe that codes of conduct, rules to go by, or instructions for completion are essential for the success of any individual.
	I do not think people realize how many directions we submit to everyday. Teachers repeatedly say to read the directions before answering. When voting we try to read all the fine print, to direct our vote to whom we want. You want to drive? Follow this list step by step. Is college your next move? Then turn in all these forms. Map Quest, give me my directions for today. The speed limit is 35 mph. Do not smoke in this area. Directions surround us all of the time. Our lives are full of instructions that we are unconscious of.  
Directions are factual. They are set up, in most cases so we can understand them. Most times they are simple and to the point. But still, even with those qualities, many people refuse to listen or to follow them. I can think back in my own life about many times when I didn't want to give in to the directions given to me, and instead, tried to figure it out on my own. I think most people have. I also think most of those people ended up starting over and wasting valuable time. My dad has always told me that I am always do things the hard way. Now I understand.
	What is it in our blood that makes us disregard directions? What, in human nature, causes us to overlook advice and instruction? Maybe there is a sense of pride inside all of us that keeps us from following steps set before us. Are we that selfish after all? Instead maybe we are just self-confidence. We might even be looking for shortcuts. Although I can not determine the reason, I know it is an inevitable quality of humans.
	The constitution is a set of directions. It is what the country follows to stay successful. The government is like us in that they try to figure how to be accomplished without any help or assistance from something put right before them. Without those direction we would not be here today as the most powerful nation in the world. The law has been set forth as a concrete foundation for the building up of our country. They include physical and social directions, but I believe there are underlying moral directions as well.
	Without direction and instruction in our lives, we as people will start to descend. We need to stick strong with our standards and listen to the advice when we are trying to accomplish a goal. With a big issue, or a small task directions can make all the difference between a make or break, win or fail, success or malfunction.

083205.txt,Laura,,,"Eugene, Oregon","June 3, 2010",2010,Appreciating everything life offers even the pain,family;self-determination;setbacks,"I believe in appreciating life and everything it has to offer. Everyday there are surprises, opportunities, and experiences waiting to happen. They may come at me from all sides and seem overwhelming and even depressing sometimes, but I believe in taking them all as positive opportunities whether they appear to be so or not.
When I was 14, my dad was dying from cancer. I was angry; angry at the world, angry at God, angry at everyone. I knew I was going to lose my dad and there was nothing anyone could do about it. Before he was too far gone, my dad asked me to come sit by his bed because he wanted to talk to me. He told me to not let this break me, not to blame God, to see this as an opportunity as he did. He told me that he viewed his illness as a way to reach out to others around him. He wanted to be sure that I understood this and would take the things that came my way in life in the same light.
I've always kept this with me and tried to apply his strength to everything I encounter. Whatever happens, good or bad at first glance, can be an opportunity if we take it as such. Appreciating the things that happen in life has really kept me in a positive mindset since that day. Even when I do let things get me down and I see no positive, I think of my dad's courage in the face of death. If dying from cancer can be viewed as an opportunity and appreciated as such, then there is nothing that can happen in this life that I should let really bring me down.
I believe in looking around all the time and really seeing the world for all the beauty and opportunity provided for us. In any situation, there are things that can be amazing, beautiful, funny, touching, and transformative. All of those experiences and situations make me who I am today and must be appreciated and valued as such. And everything that comes my way in the future, again good or bad, can contribute to becoming a better person if I make the choice to look for and appreciate the positive and learn from the negative. Even when an outcome is inevitable and painful, such as death, I learned that there can be more to it than that and that I can find something positive to appreciate in all aspects of life.

083347.txt,Evan,,Under 18,"Millington, New Jersey","June 6, 2010",2010,An Old Soul,values & spirituality,"I believe that this generation's youth, more than in any other generation, has strayed too far from the traditional morals and principles that were established to guide us. To this, I would also like to make it clear that I am part of this generation's youth; a 17 year old boy from New Jersey. 
I can remember my freshmen year of high school and being described as an ""old soul"" by some of my teachers. I was not bothered by this, but confused, as I would be told at home of my immaturity. I was further confused about being considered an ""old soul"" because not to my knowledge did I do anything different from other students my age. Then I began to think hard about what separated me from my peers. I realized that it definitely wasn't my age that led to my label, as I was young for my grade, it also wasn't my removal from technology as I had a cell phone and was capable of using computers, and then finally, I realized that it must be my behavior and what I say that labels me an ""old soul.""
This generation has so much technology right at its fingertips. Most kids today have a cell phone and, once home, are on the computer. The ability for instant communication is a wonderful technology, but is one of the ways today's youth have strayed from the path. I always believed that time spent with family, whether at a holiday gathering or at breakfast, was important. This was time to focus on the more meaningful parts of life. Yet, it seems today, there has been a breakdown in the importance of family, exacerbated by the availability of technology. Maybe I'm an ""old soul"" because I do not text at the dinner table, or do not interpret my parents to answer a call, or maybe it's because I still value time spent with my grandparents. In these regards, I am different from my generation. Technology has usurped the central focus in life away from the family. 
I believe another reason I have been labeled an ""old soul"" is that I do not listen to some of today's music. There are many elements of music today, like rap, which have disregarded more traditional values. This generation's youth listens to music which contains numerous references to drug culture and violence, profanity, and in many instances, degrades women to nothing more than a sex symbol. This music elevates the perception of gang culture, and makes it appealing to youth. So, maybe I'm an ""old soul"" for not listening to this genre of music.
I recognize that each generation's youth is trying to separate from the previous generation; whether in popular culture, language, or technology. Yet, I believe that this generation has sacrificed traditional values, such as the importance of family, reverence, and respect. And for that, I am an ""old soul,"" a title which I embrace today.

083717.txt,Nikita,,Under 18,"Briarcliff, New York","June 10, 2010",2010,I Believe in the Magic of Harry Potter,pleasure;popular culture,"If I had the chance to look into the Mirror of Erised, what would I see? The answer is simple: myself as a wizard. Yet, as much as I may desire this, I know it will never come true. As I have spent my childhood reading and rereading JK Rowling's Harry Potter novels, I have not only fallen in love with the magical world she created; I have fallen in love with its values. Harry Potter illustrates the values I choose to live my life by.
Harry Potter represents one of the greatest literary heroes. On the surface, he is a hero fighting against evil in a world wondrous to adults and children alike. However, as I began to delve further into the novels, I saw that Harry Potter was a hero fighting for something. JK Rowling's novels depict a young, independent hero fighting for his values. Harry loves his life, his schools, his friends, and he chooses to fight for them with all of his strength and passion. It illustrates one of my strongest values – to stand up for my values.  I believe that this ability to defend one's belief is what defines a person. 
Rowling's novels show the mark of a hero; the recognition of the value of independence in Harry Potter's thoughts and actions. Harry and his friends join together to fight against the Ministry of Magic (the wizard government). Societies throughout history have been faced with times of government corruption. Rowling's novels show this corruption, and the individualistic actions Harry takes to stand up for his values. Though this may be shown through wand waving and potion making, Harry illustrates the signs of a true individual. Throughout my life I have held strong values, often rejected by society. Yet, I find the strength as an individual to defend these beliefs. I believe that this individual strength is what defines a person.
""It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be."" This quote by Albus Dumbledore represents Rowling's view on the importance of free will. Free will enables people to determine their own course of action in the world. A hero is formed from the ability make these free choices. Rowling illustrates this view from the start of the first novel. As Harry sits down and the Sorting Hat is placed on his head, he begs it not to place him in the Slytherin House. The Hat's acknowledgement of this request illustrates Rowling's support of free will. Throughout the rest of the series Harry continues to make decisions of his own volition. I believe that this free will is what defines a person.
Harry Potter has been a part of my childhood, adolescence, and will continue to be a part of my adulthood.

And the quote says this:  ""The life given us by nature is short but a life well spent is eternal."" I don't now how you can interpret this awesome quote, but this is how I interpret the quote. I think it means this: The life we live on earth is short but if we make the most of it and do the absolute very best we can, then it will be remembered forever. That's why I think if you don't try your hardest and don't give it you're all, then at some point you ultimately will fail. At some point in everybody's life we will all fail but don't let that stop you. Pick yourself up get back on your horse and keep going. Don't let anything get in the way of any goal that you want to achieve. Because once you let even one negative insult or comment go to your head you maybe won't even try to complete that goal. Or maybe you're the kind of person that gets motivated when people make negative comments. I remember a time when I was raising money for Missionaries with my church and I asked 100 people to donate one dollar for every lap I do so I vowed to do 100 laps. So my best friend was doing 50 laps and was on 10 when I started and he said that I was stupid for doing 100 because I would never finish. Well of coarse it hurt a little but I was determined to finish and I ended up finishing before him and I made him feel guilty. I wasn't trying to but the youth pastor wanted me to tell my testimony  to the youth group and at the time I had no idea how long it was but It took my friend 2 hours to finish his 50 laps and took me 1 hour and a ½ to finish my 100 laps. I had ridden 12 and a ½ miles on my bike and I had no idea it was that long so I gave my testimony and he came up to me afterwards and apologized and were still friends I guess but I was considering telling him off but I used his negative comment to fuel me so that I could keep going and finish. I can't stress this enough you cant let comments go to your head. So get determined and accomplish whatever it is you want to You Can do it.

084212.txt,Tiffany ,,,"Jacksonville, Florida","July 2, 2010",2010,Family is Most Important,family;love,"There are three principles that I have incorporated in my life. These principles act as my guiding light that leads me into eternal happiness with my self. These principles are deeply in self consciousness. The principles that seem so simple to me tend to baffle others.  Treat thy neighbor as thy self, place love above all, the virtue of patience these are the forces that allow me to be at peace with my self and others. These are not principles that I was I born with but values I was taught in my early years. It is because of my family that I have such belief that these principles are the truth behind happiness.
Throughout my adolescent  these values were planted in  me like a farmer plants his or her crop. I grew up in a traditional family. Two sisters, one brother and a mother and father. My parents separated in my teenage years. Growing up with tree siblings in the home came a lot of arguments, disagreements, and even a few fights, however we were able to push  aside all the obstacles that stand in between us and love and except each other. Being in a house with many young adults were my training ground, like soldiers in basic training. If I wore one of my sisters garments I would try to return them in the same condition as I found it. This taught me to treat others and theirs belongings as I would my own. This type of behavior was contagious. We showed each other by our acts that we cared and loved each other.
The second principle that guides my life is love above all. All though I received consequences for my actions I knew that they were from a position of love and not anger. Matter of fact love is the exact opposite of anger. My parents did a great job by not only telling me they loved me but by showing it also. Whenever we were down to our last meal my parents would sacrifice by not eating so we could have more. They would watch us with a smile on their face trying to disguise the hunger that was seen so clearly on their faces. My oldest sister was an example of love when she would give me lunch money when I would carelessly leave mine at home.
The last principle is patience. As I developed as person I also developed a great deal of patience. In my teenage years I began to wear make-up more heavily which required more time in the bathroom. My brother became a great teacher for the tolerate of patience. He would never complaint nor did he become angry he would just simply wait for me to finish. I soon became aware of this behavior and returned it when I found my self waiting to do my make-up.   
Through all the lessons I learned. One thing stayed constant my family was always there. Whether from my parents or my siblings my principles were reflected in almost everything we did. I learned to treat my family as I treated my self. No matter how many arguments we had, love was always the common dominator. Patience gave me the ability to forgive and my family gave me the ability to love. If everyone practiced these principles and embraced them this world would be a better place. Therefore I strongly believe family is most important.

084629.txt,David,,,"Healdsburg, CA, California","August 1, 2010",2010,Why so Mad?,forgiveness;self-determination,"I believe getting angry or upset never helps, it only hinders. When I was younger getting upset or angry at someone, always made my life more difficult and painful. When I got angry often I would go to my room to sit alone, thinking about what made me mad. That simple act changed the anger into a disease, that bred and multiplied in my head until I could not take it anymore. I would get up, yell at the person who caused me to become wroth, and insult them so they would feel my frustration.
To try to prevent my frustration from going any further my mother would always tell me: ""if you get angry you only hurt yourself, and the other person wins"". She would tell me that being angry is bad for your health, stating: ""getting angry hurts your liver.""  So I would listen to her and just let it go; I never really understood how getting angry hurt my liver, or how the other person won, but I listened to my mother's advice because she was an adult.
From then on, I decided to ask myself: ""is it worth it to get angry over this?"" That question went unanswered until one night my father came back from work, angry about something that happened to him earlier that day. Grabbing a pack of beer, he sat in his chair outside for a while, smoking a cigarette down to the filter, then came in and started getting angry at my mom over something. I could only hear muffled shouting, and my dad getting gradually angrier at her, until I could hear his footsteps nearing my room. He slammed open my door, looked at me, and said ""what are you doing watching cartoons? Do something productive you lazy person!"" I responded, ""shut up, you're drunk! Get out!"" After about an hour of heated argument, I realized this arguing was pointless and just gave up.
After my father left I realized his anger was unprovoked and unjustified. It got me thinking: ""am I just as irrational as him when I was angry?"" Since then I realized that getting angry was pointless; anger only caused me to feel worse than I already did. I found that approaching anger with a calm and positive attitude, helped me solve, and even avoid many arguments with my friends and parents.
If I didn't let anger grow in my mind I could handle things like frustration and disappointment with ease. I learned to let anger go and plan for disaster, rather than turning a blind eye to reason and hurting someone else.

084739.txt,Iqbal,,,"Arlington, Virginia","August 12, 2010",2010,The beauty of a smile,good & evil;goodness & kindness,"I live in the DC Metro area and I use public transportation.  The other day on the DC metro I could not help staring at a girl until she got off while I missed my stop.  She smiled almost constantly with her companion.
She was not stunningly beautiful.  But her large, glassy blue eyes, pony-tailed auburn hair, and broad smile augmented her beauty, made her more beautiful than she was.  She seemed happy and carefree.  Nothing pained her; everything excited her.
She looked sincere.  She kept her eyes trained on her companion as they exchanged words.  She spoke softly but with clarity.  I stood ten feet away from her but I caught her words.  She spoke with an unfamiliar accent.  I was not sure of what — maybe Scandinavian.  
But I was not interested in her words.  It was her constant smile that weakened me, aching to love.  She glowed that matched the brightness of the metro compartment.  The DC metro lights hardly go out.  Even if they did at that moment, no one would notice the darkness.  
I watch people on the metro.  A smiling face is a gift for every one around.  It erases the stiffness of the morning and the exasperation of the after-work rides.  I have seen people light up because someone close has smiled or laughed, or even talked cheerfully.
The point of the beauty of smile is about being cheerful.  I enjoy being around people who are cheerful — people who may have a lot on their plate but they try hard to erase the burden of life, trying to be happy.  A smile or a laughter is like a therapy without seeing a therapist and spending a dime.
Being cheerful or happy is not an easy state of mind.  Our lives are constantly burdened with our everyday demands – deadlines have to be met, bosses need to be pleased, groceries and laundry must be done, kids need to be fed, social calendars must be maintained.  Having a busy and burdened life should not be a burden.  It could be a gift of meeting and fulfilling our challenges.  There are people who shy away from these challenges and become the prisoner of their own lives.
The girl I saw at the metro was not one of them.  That I am sure of.  For a brief moment she was a pure joy to be around.    
I would not trade her even for Giselle.

085140.txt,Brittany,,Under 18,"Clemmons, North Carolina","August 28, 2010",2010,Atheism In The Home,atheism;respect,"Atheism is a ""religion"" that most people don't agree with. I, personally, am atheist. I don't tell most people because I am afraid they will yell at me. It's not that I am ashamed to be atheist, it's just that I'm afraid of how people will react. When I first told my mother I was atheist, she said it was just a phase. It's not a phase, I can tell you that. I don't believe in a god, I don't believe in heaven or hell. When most people hear that, they don't believe it. It's just my personal belief. I believe that everyone is entitled to their own religion, and mine just happens to not be a religion. I am not prejudiced towards Christians or any other religions, unlike other atheists. The only thing I don't like about other religions is how they try to force religion upon me when I say I am atheist. I'm pretty sure no atheists want religion forced upon them. My mother is fine with me being atheist, and supports me in my decision, even though she herself is Christian. She promised she wouldn't shove religion down my throat, and she hasn't. 
My best friend is Christian, believe it or not. She does take me to church and her youth group meetings, trying to change me, and that's the only thing I hate about her. It doesn't bother me because I know she means well. Everyone needs to wrap it around their heads, that when we say we're atheists, we will stay that way. So try not to take us to church. Being atheist means I am a proud supporter of gay marriage, and a person that stands for the women's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. That's what I love about being atheist. If I was Christian and I had these beliefs, I would be shunned. 
Whether or not you have a religion, just be kind to all religions. They all mean well, and we do have freedom of religion. Don't tell people what they can or can't believe in. That's not nice, and it violates the Bill of Rights.

085745.txt,Richard,,,"Casa Grande, Arizona","September 8, 2010",2010,The Word Gullible isn't in the Dictionary,Christianity;faith & religion;self-knowledge,"Do you attend some sort of church? Do you believe exactly what the speaker says or do you question what they say, or do you just take what they say as the God given truth?
When I first went to church, I was a little kid. I only attended for a few years. I stopped when my mom couldn't go anymore because of work. I started going again when I was 12 because somebody had decided not to go to a Christian concert/lecture that my brother was also going to. My brother offered me the ticket, and I accepted because I had nothing better to do. The music was cool, but the lecture was boring and didn't really pertain to me. It was basically about how being gay is a sin and if you're gay you're going to go to hell and all that fun stuff. It didn't do much for me. After this, I felt I was obligated to go to the church that had given me the ticket to the event. Then I started going to their youth group. We didn't really do much like Bible studies; we just kind of got together, ate, and messed around.  But then, to go to one of the events that we went to, the youth leader required us to start attending church on Sunday morning. So I started going to one that was near my house, and one of my friends attended there. It was the same church that I had gone to with my mom when I was little. It had changed a little bit but mostly stayed the same. When I went with my mom, there were two rows of pews. They were super ugly. They were like a pinkish reddish color that was horrible. Then there was a stage with an altar right before it. Behind the stage was a baptism pool. On the walls there were tapestries with little sayings from the Bible.
 The only change to the church that I noticed was that there were black chairs with blue padding on them instead of the ugly pews. It still smelled like what you would imagine when you think of old people, that kind of drafty kind of smell that hung in the air. You could usually hear a piano playing with people singing, unless the pastor was giving his sermon. Then all you would hear was his voice droning on for what felt like forever, and then finally, after what seemed like years of him talking, it would be over. People would leave, and shake his hand at the door. 
It was at the youth group of this church that I really felt closer to God. I felt like a Christian. I wasn't a great Christian. I still drank, cursed, and did things with the opposite sex that I probably shouldn't have. But I shared my faith with people and was open about what I believed. 
After about two years of going to that youth group, I went to an event similar to the one that started me going to church on Sundays, but this one was different. It changed me. I wanted to be a better Christian so I stopped all of that bad stuff. I had a friend that also went with me, and he felt the same way. We were supposed to watch each other and offer support when the other one was doing things they shouldn't be. But then he started cursing, and it just went downhill for both of us. We didn't stop being Christians; we just stopped being good Christians and went back to our old habits.
I remember my youth pastor telling all of us ""Don't walk on the fence. You need to pick a side, because you're going to fall off of that fence one day. You're either a Christian, or you're not.""
That really stuck in my head. I knew my whole ""Christian"" life I had walked on the fence. I couldn't pick a side, because I couldn't let go of my habits. So I decided to take a break from the church life and just see what happened. I stopped going, and I felt fine. It gave me time to think about what I believed and how I was going to live my life. I had it all decided- so I thought.
One day my youth pastor showed up at my house. 
""Richard! What have you been up to?"" he asked.
""Uhh… Sleeping and stuff, you know."" I replied.
""Well we haven't been seeing you at church, and I just wanted to know what was going on, where you've been, that kind of stuff,""
""Yeah, I've just been sleeping in, and doing homework, that kind of stuff,"" I reply, not having the courage to tell him what the real story was, knowing he would go on a religious tirade if I did.
""Well we've missed seeing you, and we would really like it if you would come to youth group tonight,"" he said.
""I'll see,"" I said, thinking ""I'm screwed if I go because they'll start expecting me to go to everything again, but screwed if I don't because they'll keep hounding me to go.""
I wound up going, and I started going to things again for about a month. But then I decided I was tired of going, tired of believing exactly how they did. I stopped going. The friend that I had that went to that church with kept telling me that I needed to go to church and was basically hinting that I was a devil worshipper in their eyes because I didn't go anymore. This wasn't true at all; I'm nothing close to a devil worshiper. My personal belief is that there is a God, but I don't agree with the theory of a church. But I'm not writing this to debate religion so let me get to the real point of the story. 
I let other people choose what I believed for years. Once I separated from my church I finally believed what I felt was right. It didn't come without consequences though.  I was scared to go to the store because I was worried about running into people that might try to pressure me into going to church. I almost felt like I was being stalked because I was constantly afraid they would go to my house to try to get me back in church.
This is what I believe. Believe what you feel is right. Don't believe things because that's what other people want. Believe what makes the most sense to you whether it's Christianity, Atheism, or whatever you choose. The main point is that you choose it. Don't let somebody force what they believe on you. 
We're raised in a society with beliefs constantly shoved down our throats not just dealing with religion, but everything; which phone is good to have, what clothes are cool, all of these are basically just us following what other people believe. It's true that some phone might be more durable than another, or a certain pair of pants are more comfortable than another, but usually what controls what we buy is other people's opinions, and opinion is a synonym for the word belief.
How can you live your life without following what other people believe? I have no idea how to believe exclusively my own beliefs. I don't think it's possible. The way I try to live my life is by listening to what others have to say, and if I find that it could be valuable or true then I add it to what I believe. If I think that person sharing with me has ulterior motives then I don't take what they have to say to heart. 
People are always going to try to persuade you to believe what they do. That's what I'm doing right now with this essay. What you need to do is filter the truth from the lies, get rid of the obvious lies and learn from what people have to say.  Don't buy into what people say right away. Instead, look into what the reward might be for them if you believe what they're telling you. If you believe everything you hear, then what do you believe? How do you live your life?

My grandpa is my idol. He has overcome so many obstacles in his life, and deserves all the success he has earned. At 84 years of age, and no other health conditions, finding out he had cancer struck my family hard. After trying to get second opinions or finding alternative help, my family and I realized we had to accept the news.
I was so upset for a while that I wasn't thinking about the present. I was too focused on the fact that it was incurable, instead of taking advantage of the time I still had with him. I came to realize that instead of worrying how long he has to live, I need to embrace every day that he is still here. I love visiting him more than ever before, and cherishing the time I have with him. I am thankful for everyday that he is still here. Focusing on the positives of his life, hearing his amazing stories, and remembering the good times, has helped both my grandpa and I stay positive through the tough times.
I have come to realize that if I was to worry everyday on the health of my grandpa that I would be throwing away precious time. Time is of the essence with my grandpa and I have to treat everyday like it's his last. I have found that living in the moment has opened my eyes to a new outlook on life. I can now find the positives of an otherwise upsetting situation. My grandpa and I are closer than ever before and I am thankful for the times we've shared. I now know that when he does pass, I will remember the lasts of our good times and be appreciative that they weren't wasted. I believe that people should live in the moment and be thankful for what they have at that moment, rather than worry about what they will or will not have in the future.

God does not take attendance at church and there are no quotas to fill.  
God has only ever cared about one thing – and that one thing is love.   Love is the goal, the means, and the only measure of success.   When we love, God's smile shines brightly.  
God is love.  God's light is present in every human being. We honor God by living in the here and now, and not for the promise of some unknown heaven.  Redemption and the kingdom of heaven are to be experienced here in this world, here in this moment.  
Therefore…
Let us live humble and extraordinary lives that honor the promise of human potential  
Let us honor and defend the inherent rights of all human beings 
Let us work to heal what is broken and make right every injustice  
Let us live simply so that our abundance does not result in scarcity for others
Let us live lives of integrity so that our actions align with what we believe and say
Let us acknowledge and celebrate what is right with the world

People show cruelty everyday all over the world. Whether it is a person or an animal that the cruelty is done to makes no difference. I have had cruelty done to me personally and I have seen it done to so many others. It is something that is hard to watch and even harder to experience. The person who is taking out their cruelty on others is usually also in pain. That cruelty they are giving out is coming from a place where it hurts so much that to them the only way of getting rid of it or at least making it feel better is taking it out on someone else. Everyone does it, we all have our days when we are so hurt by somebody that we take that anger and hurt out on someone else. When I learned from other students, family and people in the past is that when the person who picks on people finds that, the someone they used to pick on can defend themselves and can fight back, they find someone usually within the next hour, day, or week to pick on for the rest of the year. I believe that there are some people who are in more pain than others and that is why they take it out on the people who are susceptible to being cruel to.

     Growing up I had been very close to my father.  I do not remember him ever speaking one unkind word to me.  My parents divorced when I was six and I would spend most weekends with him.  We would go grocery shopping for junk food, then watch our favorite movies, such as ""Over the Top"" with Sylvester Stallone.  We'd rewind the finale arm wrestling match at the end to watch over and over again, and cheer like we were there every time.   My dad would push the coffee table against the couch and let me do cartwheels in the living room.  I would land, and then jump so he could catch me, like we were performing a complicated gymnastics routine.
     When I became a busy and somewhat self absorbed teenager, I spent a little less time at dad's and more on my social life.  My dad had his ways to remain close to me.  He would be at the kitchen table chatting with my mom when I got home from school just to see how my day was.  There were always flowers for my birthday or if I was sick.  He called before bed every night to say he loved me, and we would still watch ""Over the Top"" with pepperoni pizza rolls for dinner when I'd stay over.  At the end of my junior year he insisted on signing my year book.  To this day I can't figure out why, but I am now glad he did.   ""To my lovely daughter, whom I love with all my heart: I'm sure you'll succeed in whatever you do.  Love you so much honey.  Love, Dad.""  That is, in a nutshell, how he treated me every day of my life.
     Then a day went by without hearing from him.  This wasn't normal.  When he didn't respond to my phone calls, I remember him saying he'd had stomach pain the day before, and on a whim called the hospital to see if he was there.  I honestly did not expect anything to come of it, but I was told he had been admitted, and wasn't conscious.  When I arrived he was jaundice and heavily sedated.  I felt so small, just a kid standing in the hospital hallway, watching staff hustle by.  I finally flagged down a nurse, and she located my father's doctor. He told me in the kindest way possible that my dad had pancreatic cancer.  There was nothing they could do, and he had less than two months to live.  During the car ride home I cried so hard I had to pull over.  I begged God for help.  I told him I never ask for much, and he could not take the person I leaned on the most.  I screamed that it wasn't fair.
     My dad never remarried, and wasn't very close to his siblings.  He was only 41, and hadn't planned for this.  I was not a child anymore, I was now my father's next of kin, and the person he and his nurses counted on.  They moved him to a facility for hospice care.  The medication would cause him confusion, and I'd get a call to leave school because he'd be trying to leave the building, and wouldn't listen to anyone except for me.  I would sit in a chair next to his bed every night.  Sometimes I'd read until I'd fall asleep, but mostly I would talk to him for hours, even though towards the end the conversations were one sided.  I just wanted him to hear how much I cared, like he showed me every chance he could.  My mom visited often, and once in a while I'd catch a class, or run home to shower.  My 16 year old brother could not handle being around my father very much, but I did not resent it.  It's as if I could feel the pain radiating from him whenever he was visiting the nursing home, and I desperately wanted to protect him.  On November 17, 2001, 5 weeks after his diagnosis, my dad passed away
There is no describing the grief I felt.  I graduated, began taking some classes at the local college, and worked as a nanny.  I lived my life, but there wasn't much direction and there was always a hollow space inside of me.  Eventually I met a friend who was a nursing assistant, and she suggested I go into health care.  I decided to give it a try.  After my first day of clinical training I knew it was where I belonged.  I immediately began pulling from experience to make me better at my job.  When I began working in hospice, I would look into the eyes of a family member and see the complicated emotions I still felt deep inside me.   I would take their hand and say, ""I know where you are right now.  I know how it is to live this way.""   I now work on a surgical floor at a hospital.  I see myself in every family member that is sleeping in a straight back chair next to a bed, and I see my father in every patient that I touch.  It provides me with endless patience, and compassion.  Whenever I am helping someone take a drink of water, assisting them in walking down the hall way, or covering them with a blanket, there are two people being healed, and one of them is me.
The heartbreak of losing my dad was like acid.  I feel like instead of letting it eat me alive I am using it to discover a purpose that fills my soul.  It is motivating me to become a nurse.  It makes me thankful I can understand people's needs, even if it was a traumatic experience that taught me how.  I believe you have a choice.  Let your pain overcome you.  Wonder why it happened to you.  You could surrender.  Or you can acknowledge your grief, embrace it, then stand up and say, ""This is what I have learned.  And this is how I will use it to better my life, and the lives of others.""  You may surprise yourself.

087324.txt,Tonya,,Under 18,"Hillsboro, Oregon","September 30, 2010",2010,Natural Horsemanship,pets & animals,"Horses aren't just an animal, they are way of life. Many people all around the world dedicate their lives to these amazing creatures. They were one of our first sources of transportation; they pulled our first Taxi's and plowed our fields. They were mail carriers and our faithful companions. Several people still train, raise and breed them. There are many ways to train a young horse or any horse. The way I would train any horse is natural horsemanship which is what I'm about to explain. I believe natural horsemanship is the best way to train horses. When I use this my horse starts to respond quicker and learns more every time he does something right. The general meaning of natural horsemanship is to ask the horse to do something until the animal gets it right.
I have been riding horses in 4-H for a little over two years but before that I took lessons and volunteered at different stables in Oregon. I helped around the barn and they gave me lessons on different horses they had. Since I joined 4-H I have learned a lot about how to train a horse and using natural horsemanship. I don't like forcing my horse to do things. I want him to be comfortable doing it by himself. If he's scared of something, I give him something to do around it like riding or lunging in circles until he's brave enough to go up to it without freaking out. This method has worked so many times for me.
Horses learn from everything you do with them so every little thing counts. So if I wanted to ride him in a new arena, I would lunge him in there first so that he's brave while I'm on the ground and gets some of his energy out before I get on him. If I just went into an arena and immediately got on he would most likely get scared, bolt and start bucking. I'm the type of person who learns from my mistakes and, trust me, I actually did that once and ended up going to the ER. My horse, Apollo, bucked me off because he was freaked out over the smell of cattle and the chutes in the outdoor arena at the Yamhill county fairgrounds. When he jumped over me after I fell off and his back hoof hit my arm. It hurt pretty badly so they made me go to the ER and get X-rays. Nothing broke but I did scrape it and still have scars (dark marks on my elbow). 
Natural Horsemanship is the most effective way I have used without hurting or scaring my horse. I believe in this completely. It angers me to see someone hurting their horse just because he/she was scared of something or did something wrong. What I have learned mostly came from a man named Steve Rother. He's pretty famous in the horse world. He owns Horse Creek Ranch and does clinics around Oregon to teach other people of Natural Horsemanship. His clinics are expensive to be in but are interesting to watch. 
I love working with horses. They are beautiful animals and are very smart. I spend a lot of time with them.   I am with the horses almost every weekend, all summer and sometimes on Wednesdays. I think everyone should give them a chance. You never know, they could become your new best friend.

087434.txt,Cristina,,Under 18,"Hillsboro, Oregon","October 3, 2010",2010,I Believe Everyone Deserves to Know the Truth,integrity,"I believe everyone deserves to know the truth.  Even though the truth may be harsh, it is better to know sooner than later. What if your best friend had lied to you about knowing a secret that someone else told you.  How would you feel?  In this situation, I feel there is no love from my friend.  Honesty is a key point for any kind of relationship.  If I lied often to a close friend or family member, why would they even have a thought to trust me?  
            Once, I lied to my parents about where I was heading to one evening.  Looking back, I honestly could not believe I had done this.  It was one of the most terrifying nights of my life.   Almost two years ago, my best friend's parents own a shop in down town Hillsboro, where the Tuesday market happens. My best friend and I decide to take a walk by there.  It was nine-thirty-two and we thought everything would be fine, but our thoughts were wrong.  As we are walking through the streets we come across a lady with hair red as fire, fishnets on her legs,  and a skirt so short that well, we saw things we didn't want to see.  My best friend says to me ""Lets get out of here before any of them sees us.""  My response was ""That's a good idea, let's not waste time here.""  While we start to head back home a guy in all black walks near the lady.   At this moment I was very scared. My heart was beating so hard I could feel my pulse all over my body.  The guy walks by us, asking for our name and where we go to school.  Thank goodness he turned around, and walked back to the fire hair lady.  My lie to my parents?  I promised them to not leave the shop.  The next morning they pick me up from the shop, I was very scared and nervous to tell them.  My mind was deciding on to tell them or not.  I had no choice if I wanted them to trust me.  My voice finally woke up, I absolutely got in major trouble.  Now, they trust me to tell them the truth. 
            It's a good thing I told them, because if they would've found out now about this, my privileges would blow up into thin dust.  I am a very honest person, I rarely keep secrets.  Now, ever since that night I listen to my parents, and stay where I'm suppose to stay.  If I hadn't told my parents about this would they be hurt a lot more? Or trust me less?  That's why teens need to stop hiding so many secrets from their parents.  It bothers me when anyone says ""My parents don't trust me."" I wonder why?  My parents trust me a lot more than I think.  That is something to be proud of myself for, so teens should always have a open relationship with their parents.

These last two years were full of ups and downs. More downs than ups. In my 7th grade year I believed that I was untouchable. That nobody could hurt me and that nothing could ""phase"" me. I had the attitude that I was the best and no body was better. This was defiantly a wrong idea of my self. 
I had been saying really rude things about a girl I had never even met before, say that I could beat her up if she ever came up to me I thought I could "" take on the world"". Of course things got a round and she found out. She came and confronted me about it was very honest with me. She said somethings I NEEDED to here. Things that were hurtful and far to inappropriate to repeat but they did have to be said. I in return mouthed off and just kept running my mouth.
This was not my best idea. She started to walk away and I yelled at her, she turned a round and hit me. I was very shocked at first then I was over come with anger. We fought.
There was no clear winner or loser because we were both beaten up pretty bad. When we sat down in the office we were both suspended for 3 days. This was one of my wake up calls. 
Then next year I was involved in one other fight. This fight was entirely different and is the reason why I believe that it is always better to have no ideas than false ones; to believe nothing, than to believe what is wrong. I had the idea that is okay to fight. This was also false.
Me second fight was the one that I regret the most. My family was fighting a lot and I open up to one girl. Her and I got mad at each other and she told everyone what was happening. I started yelling at her and then  just beat the crap out of her. At first I thought it was the right thing to do but then I later found out it wasn't I felt so bad!
When you believe in something that is wrong you will begin doing these things thinking they are right. This is what happened to me.

Suicide is a growing problem in our society. From Bullying to not feeling loved. Many people of all ages are taking away their lives to be somewhere so they can feel loved.
In the past 10 months i have known 5 or 6 people to take away their own lives. And i know multiple people who know a different 5 or 6 people that have taken away their lives. Out of the 6 people i have known, three have been friends. Good, close friends. The first to pass away was one of my families first friend when we moved into a new community. He was a sweet guy with such a big heart. But he was hiding his pain from the world. He experienced many hard trials in his life and i feel as though he didn't feel loved as much as he wanted. The second was one of my dear best friends. She always had a smile on her face and everyone loved her. She had many friends and loved everyone. Once again, she was hurting inside. So much that she felt she couldn't tell us all of her pain. She didn't feel loved by all of her friends. She didn't feel the strong friendship I had for her and as well as many other. The last was a little brother to me. Always at my house playing the drums while my brother strummed his guitar. I drove him around everywhere and enjoyed having him around all the time. If he would have realized how much his family loved him, my family loved him, and the community loved him i am sure he would have never pulled the trigger. 
If all of these kids would have felt the love that there was for them, the people left behind would not have to be suffering. I am suffering, their families are suffering, and all of their other friends. We have all pulled together and loved each other as much as we ever had. Take the minute to compliment the person you think looks pretty. Put forth an effort to tell the ones you love how much you love them, daily. love, love, love. 
Do little things for those around you. Smile when they look sad. Make them laugh when they are crying. Do everything you can to make someones life better.
Lets prevent suicide. Lets make this world a happier place with more love. Lets make friendships that will last forever, that will prevent wrong doings and save a life. This i believe, in love.

087854.txt,Melissa,,,"Bangor, Maine","October 10, 2010",2010,The Physical Power of Nursing,work,"I believe in the physical power of nursing.  Nursing is a profession that allows one to engage all aspects of their body all day long.  Nurses not only interact with patients by words, charting, and by being liaisons between doctors; they physically interact with their patients.  This is unlike any other profession; an intimate relationship develops between the nurse and patient.  Trust and bonding develops.  I strongly believe in the physical power of nursing because it bonds patients and nurses and it distinguishes the nursing profession from any other profession.  
I began nursing school when I was twenty years old.  To some people this would seem incredibly young.  To me, however, this seemed impossibly too late.  I questioned myself often if I had wasted too much time figuring out what it was that I wanted to do.  I had already taken one semester off from school and completed one semester of business school.  I now questioned if nursing truly was the right choice for me.  Although it did not take me long to figure out that nursing school was the perfect fit for me, it was not until I had patients of my own that I realized exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  It was then I knew I was in the right spot; I had made the correct decision.  I realized I believed in the physical power of nursing.
After my first semester of classes, I was working incredibly hard and bringing in grades that I had never accomplished before in any high school or college setting.  In school, I loved to learn about the human body and learn about the nursing skills we would one day be mastering.  Something was missing though.  Daily after school, I would venture across town to my waitressing job, where I worked for the past few years.  Night after night, I served customers dinner at a local restaurant and then went home to finish homework for nursing school.  I needed a change, something that would engage me physically in the medical field.
I began to research what types of work I could train for, if any.  As I looked online, a few options to choose from but nothing caught my interest. I began to look into an EMT course that was being offered.  It seemed like a reasonable class that was fun and upbeat.  The problem was I did not think I would be able to do anything with it once I was through with the class.  I signed up anyway.  When I began the class, I immediately fell in love with how hands on the profession was, and how many interventions emergency medical technicians are allowed to perform.  I loved the interaction between the EMTs and the staff and hospitals, nursing homes, and medical facilities.  
When the class was over, I was able to sit for my license, become a nationally registered EMT-B, and begin a job with G&H Ambulance.  I work on the emergency truck, the transfer truck and get to travel to many hospitals, work with many healthcare professionals and meet different patients every single day and late night.  When I meet new patients, venture to new hospitals or even learn a new skill, it reinforces my decision to become a nurse.  When I meet new patients I am required to assess them and it is a bonding moment. Nursing is a never-ending profession.  There are always new patients to meet, new skills to learn and new places to travel.  I love that the profession is a physical one, where you are always on your feet, interacting with patients and their families.
Now that second year of nursing school is starting and I am working at G&H ambulance simultaneously, it is interesting to see the similarities and differences between the two professions.  Each run I make at G&H makes me want to learn more about the medical field and nursing school teaches me the things I will need to know for my future career.  I am beginning to learn physical skills for my future nursing career, and I work in a physical job.  I am looking forward to a long career in the field of nursing.  Though I do not know what exactly I want to do once I have graduated from school yet, I know I have plenty of options.  The field is endless.  It is comforting to know that I have finally settled into the correct path for myself, and that I love what I am doing here and now.

I believe that leadership is when you can be responsible.  An example of a leader is Kobe Bryant because he led the Lakers to three NBA championships in a row.  He leads his team and is a very responsible role model that everyone wants to be like.  Kobe Bryant is a perfect example of leadership.
I believe that respect is when you consider someone worthy of high regard.  An example of respect is your parents; they do so much for you and ask for nothing in return.  Especially your mom.  She cleans cooks and washes all your stuff and doesn't complain.  IF I could respect anyone in the world it would defiantly be my mom.
I believe loyalty is when you pledge yourself to your football team, to stay out of trouble and play at every game.  When you sign up for football you are signing up to have loyalty to your coach and your team mates.  Even if you don't start you still half to show up to every practice and stay out trouble so you can start.
All in all I believe in many things, but these three are the most important in my life.

088329.txt,Nichole,,,"San Luis Obispo, California","October 18, 2010",2010,Breakfast for Champions,family;values & spirituality,"Beep…beep…beep. You wake to your alarm going off just like you do every day. You turn to switch it off and, Oh no! It's 7:55, you have to be in class at 8:10, and that wasn't your alarm going off; it was your best friend calling to tell you not to forget your calculator for the midterm that you both have this morning! Obviously you're going to have to make some sacrifices to your morning schedule. What will they be? Taking a shower? Doing your hair? Putting actual clothes on instead of running out the door in your pajamas? Many people would probably sacrifice eating breakfast but I wholeheartedly believe in eating breakfast every morning. It has been proven to be physically healthy for you and in my experience mentally healthy for you.
Most people know that breakfast is a very important meal. Still, many people skip it. Many people think that skipping breakfast helps them lose weight but it actually has the opposite effect. According to webmd.com, a popular medical website, ""Skipping breakfast allows the body to stay in a hibernation-like state which burns only minimal calories."" Breakfast also helps you to be more efficient throughout the day. In an article on mayoclinic.com about healthy breakfast it states that eating breakfast causes you to, ""have better concentration and productivity throughout the morning,"" meaning you will be more awake, alert, and accomplish more throughout the day. There are even more benefits besides physical benefits to eating breakfast. 
Breakfast can be a time to relax before the busy day starts.  Even if you're in a rush, breakfast can be a reminder to take some time for yourself. For me, breakfast meant time to sit and talk with my dad. Ever since I can remember, I would wake up, walk into the kitchen, pour whatever cereal fits my mood that day, and sit next to my dad while he reads the paper, eats a muffin, and drinks his coffee. We would talk about anything that came to our minds. When I was younger, it used to be about why I had to have the new Barbie that I saw on T.V. or why I wanted a pony so badly. As I got older, our conversations got more realistic and meaningful such as why it was so important to go to college. The twenty minutes every day that we enjoyed breakfast together contributed to our close, father-daughter bond. 
I know many people don't or can't sit down for breakfast with their fathers. However, breakfast can still be useful in different ways. Reading a book, or even just mindlessly musing are ways to use breakfast to your advantage. Now that I'm in college and I don't have the luxury of enjoying breakfast with my dad, I use the time I take for breakfast as an excuse to do the things that I want to do but don't have time for during the rest of my day. So the next time that you're running late for a midterm, grab a granola bar, and as you're running to class, don't think about the equations that you forgot to memorize but rather use the time that it takes you to eat the granola bar for yourself.

088488.txt,M,,,"Charleston, South Carolina","October 20, 2010",2010,This I Believe: Evolution,science,"Over the years, I have struggled on believing in evolution and whether it was actually real according to my beliefs or not.  Basically, I have been juggling creationism and evolution.  I was raised in a Christian home and surrounded by a religious community until I attended college.  My mind was opened at that time and I was able to form my own opinions based on what I was learning and what I already knew.  
I was never actually one hundred percent sure on what the details of evolution were until my biology 102 lecture that I am enrolled in now.  I tried steering clear of the subject, because of my religious background.  My professor recently showed our class an episode of NOVA revolving around evolution.  NOVA is a television series broadcasted by PBS that revolves around making the world of science exciting!  After viewing this episode, I was informed of many things about the Planet Earth that I had no idea about before.  
Over three billion years ago, this planet we live on right now was a very destructive place that no living thing could dream of surviving on.  It is believed that meteorites crashing into the earth were the initial existence of life form.  Amino acids, which are the building blocks of life, were found in samples of these asteroids.  It is hard to believe that any living thing was able to survive in these harsh conditions.  With this given information, it is fascinating to think that there are other life forms in space that we have yet to discover.  Being informed that evolution is one of the most accurate scientific theories has formed my opinion over time as well.  
With my recent gain of knowledge, I am able to say that I do believe in evolution.  Beginning with amino acids, more and more living things were formed out of this by simply the world changing and organisms adapting to their environment.  This all makes perfect sense to me now!  I am also able to incorporate my religious background in this theory as well.  While I believe evolution is true, I can also believe that there is a higher being, or God, that formed certain types of life as well.  
After watching this episode of NOVA, I have also begun to think about how these amino acids link to form peptide and polypeptide bonds.  Due to multiple meteorites hitting the Earth's surface, multiple amino acids are able to connect forming these peptide and polypeptide bonds.  These bonds continue to grow and grow forming new complex forms of life.  
These fascinating details on the Earth's history have actually made a positive influence on my attitude toward science!  It seems that science is an endless study and will continue to reflect and add to the already existing theories.  I look forward to hearing about new findings!

Every human being is capable of learning literature, science, politics and all other fields created since the period of nomads, as long as they have the will to fight and overcome the obstacles. No day is perfect, each and every one of them has there ups and downs, that's why I believe in making the best out of it. It is easy to give up, complain and get angry, but I choose to appreciate and work with the present situation. Life is like a shattered crystal, no one finds all of the pieces, that is why I have learned to be satisfied with what I have, instead of being upset over what I do not have. 
I believe my mental state has been shaped like this because of my inability of memorizing things. Back in India, strategy to understand material was memorizing everything without any explanation. I guess this was because teachers were too busy beating up the students rather than trying to explain what they were doing wrong. I did terrible in all the subjects, except math. I was good at math because it was more analytic, than cramming. When I figured out why I was good at math, I also figured out why I was terrible at the other subjects. I did not regret the fact that my cramming skills were horrible because I knew I could find a way around with my ability to see things logically and I did. 
I believe perfection does not exist; nothing in this world is perfect, except maybe GOD. Theories, technology, etc, all of them have pros and cons and so does my worldview. The shortcoming of my belief is time.  In other words, anything is achievable as long as one is willing to put in the work and determination into it, but the amount of time it might take to be successful can vary and can affect one's life. Take me for example, I wanted to be a tennis pro which is achievable, but the amount of time it will take me to become a pro is unreasonable in terms of survival and earning bread. What I mean is that I will be wasting my youth becoming a tennis player, instead of working on a career that will assure me a secure life later on. If the time was available in unlimited amount, then may be, my view or my opinion could have been perfect.
I believe ""Opportunity follows struggle. It follows effort. It follows hard work. It does not come before"" by Shelby Steele, meaning things like hope, miracles, dreams.. can only come true if one is determined to put the work in and take the suffering head on.

089327.txt,Mark,,Under 18,"St. Louis, Missouri","November 6, 2010",2010,The Perfect High Needs No Leaf,hope;values & spirituality;work,"Anyone who's ever read Shel Silverstein's ""Perfect High"" has more likely than not pondered the script long and hard. There are many lines to ponder, but one excerpt that stands out the most to me is ""If you're to find the perfect high you must look within yourself"". Do you remember the first time you learned you were going on an airplane? You were probably very young, and very excited. Most adults don't get excited because they know that the trip consists of hours of sitting in cramped spaces with a pounding headache and a sensation in their ears that resembles hot nails being shoved in; but to a little kid, it means going super-duper high and flying through the clouds, faces glued to the windows looking down at all the ants and toy cars, imagining what is going on all the way on earth. I believe in natural highs. That's not to mean organic pot, or even something as exhilirating as skydiving. What I believe to be a natural high is the ability to enjoy the small things in life. 
The Spanish treat people watching as a sport, and I believe that comes from the fasination people have with others. People are amazing. Have you ever thought about the circulatory system, how many thousands of miles of veins and capalaries it has? I believe that God put these small wonders in our lives with the intent that we discover them, and to pursue that intention is to pursue the perfect high.
I remember my first wrestling match. It was the third period with the score tied when my opponent grabbed both my legs and swiftly threw me down to the mat. Neither of us was very good at the time so in the end it came down to who still had the energy to finish. He won because he worked harder than me. I want to stress the word worked, because I believe that the feeling he felt afterwards when he realized his work played off was simply amazing. 
There is no greater reward than to be recognized for hard work. For some this means having the vanity of others in the form of praise, but for the minority, it means knowing that their hard work has meant something. Working smart is important too, but to really reach euphoria one needs to work hard. I believe in these highs. I believe in adrenaline and not THC, love instead of ecstasy, and work over of sloth and greed. These values are in the man I hope to become to. I do not yet see him in the mirror, and maybe I never will, but I aspire to be him relentlessly.

This is probably because you didn't give your best. I believe that if you put your mind to something you can do it. Nothing is impossible. You have to give it your all; otherwise you may not accomplish your goal. Nobody likes to fail period.
I myself haven't always given it 100%. When I don't give it my all I usually fail. But, when I try I succeed. Success to me makes me feel great. This is always a great feeling to me when I succeed. I have watched my brother give it his all in wrestling. He always works hard in practice. Watching him makes me realize if I give it my all and always try my hardest I could be a lot better. He won state this past year because he worked hard and stuck to the basics. If you stick to the basics in life and don't do fancy stuff you should be alright. If you try to get all fancy in life, it's going to make it much harder to get by. That's why famous people have such a hard time getting to go to everyday places without being ambushed by all the paparazzi and fans.
When I don't give it my all I fail. I absolutely hate failing just like most people do. I have started to realize that when I give it my all I succeed. When I succeed in school that not only makes me happy but it also makes my parents happy. When my parents are happy that means I get to do more stuff. When I succeed I get to have more privileges and responsibilities. This is huge and often hard to handle. But, I would rather have more responsibilities and privileges than have none at all.
Next time you think ""Oh, I will just blow this off it wont hurt me"" DON'T! Even though you think it's alright to do, it still is an instant failure. You can't succeed if you don't do any work. So therefore, never blow off any assignment, chore, or responsibility. Because before you know it your grades will drop and all your privileges will be gone.
In conclusion, you should always give it your all and never give up. You have to always give your best effort.

I have been raised in a society of people that believe that stem-cell research is murder, but in the beginning of 2006, news came out that though islet-cell transplant, a form of embryonic stem-cell research, scientist have been able to counteract a few symptoms of type-1 diabetics and in some cases cure diabetes. The sensitive technology of islet-cell transplant has become somewhat successful and has permanently changed the lives of a handful of diabetics, but with further research and development involving stem cells, this procedure might become more successful. 
I at one time was one of those ignorant people that really didn't understand what the ""stem cell research""  but judgment to people who advocated for it, but when I heard that it might be what brings a cure to my disease I did some research. I found out that actually embryonic stem cell research is when a scientist studies a human embryo that they obtain by means of in vitro fertilization, a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb, which to me didn't sound like murder. I had always believed that the fertilized egg actually had a chance at becoming a person, but in reality the fertilized eggs would never form a child. So, with more research I found out that when people so bluntly state, ""Stem cell research is murder"", they are stating that human existence starts from the moment that the egg is fertilized and that despite its short existence and despite the fertilized eggs not contain any human-like characteristics are still human.
The decision to make is ""do you believe that fertilized eggs are a form of human life""? When you think about Stem cell research, you must also understand and consider that with stem cell research, scientist have made great medical strives. Stem cell research has enlightened the scientific world about when Cancer and birth defects are developed in the human body, which shifted and greatly impacted the study of both, bringing scientist one-step closer to cures. No one would ever argue that the products that derive from stem cell research are not great strives in the medical/scientific world. Personally with a greater understanding of stem cell research, I as a person with type-1 diabetes my attitude towards stem-cell research has been permanently altered.

090105.txt,Kelly,,,"Austin, Texas","November 29, 2010",2010,A Life's Scrapbook,creativity;pleasure;self-knowledge,"I believe life is a scrapbook, a collection of moments to cherish and preserve. Every moment, every picture deserves its own place and has a story to tell. I myself am a photo freak. I love to have fun, be silly, and force my friends and family into pictures with me. In high school, sure I bought a yearbook to remember the good old days. However, every one is exactly the same, yet I can guarantee no two students had the same high school experience. That's the reason why I love my scrapbook, it shows my life. My friends, my favorite memories, and my personality are drizzled throughout the pages. It's as unique as I am.
Life is a work of art, a freedom of expression. I love having the ability to be my own person and do whatever I like. I feel individuality is a gift I must embrace in order to live my life to the fullest. I mean, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One recently came out, and there I was with purple hair, a wand, and a punk outfit dressed as Tonks at twelve in the morning jumping out of my seat with excitement. It is this kind of expression, passion, and enthusiasm that I tend to remember and laugh about. 
The pages in my scrapbook have developed and changed, in the same manner as me. In the early pages, it was all about having bright colors and patterns, correlating with my young, care-free personality. Towards the end of high school and into college, the pages became much more sophisticated and elegant, expressing my maturity over the years. While both styles are distinctly different, they're both still me. And that's the beauty of life. I am a collage of my past, my present, and what I hope my future to be. 
For me, life is about making a mental scrapbook. Having a series of snapshots, a collection of sayings, and a compilation of memories to think about and smile. Looking at it this way, my life is meaningful, and it's one of a kind. This I believe.

090144.txt,Melissa,,,"Darien, Illinois","November 29, 2010",2010,Family Matters,family;gratitude,"Family is the most important thing in the world. Having an amazing family make me the luckiest person there is. I never realized how fortunate I am to have such a large, supportive family. We are always there for each other, and we are extremely close. There is no dreaded small-talk during Thanksgiving, or hugs out of politeness during parties. We are all up-to-date on one another's lives and know when any of us is going through a rough time. A great family is invaluable.
When I say family, I mean my extended family. I am just very fortunate that my extended family is just as close as my immediate family. My Mother's parents are from Italy and each has a large family of their own. I am not as close with them because there are so many relatives that I haven't even met. My mother is one of four girls, all with their own husbands and children. I have 14 first cousins just on my mom's side, with two more on the way. Growing up we would get together for every single birthday, holiday, sports game, and any random night for coffee when we haven't been together in a while (more than a couple weeks). My mom's family is younger and I have cousins ranging from newborn to 28 years old. We would meet and just simply talk and hang out for hours. It's like having a big group of best friends that you're completely comfortable around. I appreciate that so much.
My Dad is one of five kids, who also have their own families. The majority of my dad's family is older. My cousins on his side are now adults, some with their own kids. My dad's family is not as close as my mom's, but it is definitely just as large. We always got together for birthdays and special occasions, but nothing more. Though I am much closer with the younger generation of my mom's family, I still appreciate both sides immensely. 
Just recently, when talking to others about their Thanksgiving, I was surprised to hear that many people's holiday consists of a handful of people sitting around a table for the normal feast. My Thanksgiving consisted of 35 people, four tables pushed together, two large turkeys, and an endless supply of food; and it could not have been better. 
I know that my family means the world to me because it is the first thing I think of whenever I need something. They are the first people I think to ask when I have an important decision to make. They are the first people I go to when I want opinions on anything. I have grown up knowing that no matter what, I can always go home and it is a safe spot for me. Having a built-in support system like that is priceless and I think everyone should have it. Never take your family for granted and realize how lucky you are to have them.

090591.txt,Farzana,,,"Belaire, Kansas","December 6, 2010",2010,My Family,family;love,"Everyone has their own opinion about strength. Some think that strength comes from exercise and sweat, others think it comes from hardship and overcoming obstacles, and then there are those who know otherwise. During my life I have had a great many experiences that have made me develop my strength but no area of my life has given me more strength than my family. When I think of strength I think of it as something more than what can be lifted or endured, I think of it as something that we grow from; in a word, family.
What I believe is that a person's strength lies in their family strength. Without a supportive loving family a person will have a hard time growing up and developing into an independent confident person who can know what real happiness and love is all about. I came from a very close family that was always there during any good time and any hardship. No matter what was going on in my life my family was always there offering advice or making me smiles through it, just as they do today. Knowing that I will always have my family by my side gives me real strength beyond what could ever be measured. 
Every moment from the very beginning my parents taught me everything I needed to grow up. They taught me how to read, write, walk, and talk and not to mention everything else in between. My brothers taught me how to get into trouble… and sometimes how to get out of it. When I think back on my life growing up, not one memory is complete without someone from my family. For this reason, I believe my strength and independence comes from that deep connection with my roots and also my roots lead to my future. When I married I gained a family. My husband's parents and siblings have become good support for me also through what I have experienced since I met them.
When I became a mother I relied on my family and my husband's family for what to do next. Aunts and uncles from both sides are a second support for my daughter just as her cousins are. Family is important because you can never loose that kind of bond the way you might lose a friend. I try my hardest everyday to make my daughter's life happy and show her she will never be alone. It's not easy to raise a child but with enough love and commitment I have no doubt that she will be every bit as happy and successful as I have been. 
This assignment asks for me to share what I believe. That brought a lot of things to mind. Some of the things that came to me are a lot of ideologies, a lot of opinions, and also a lot of questions. In the end, I decided to write about something very personal that I am also very proud of, my family. The easiest way to say it is to say that I believe without the strength of a family than a person has no strength at all.

come together when a loved one is wounded. I believe that no matter
what, family will always have my back. They are there for me whenever
I'm in need, and I will always be there for them in return. I believe
that my life is so much better because of devotion, and care. I believe in my family.
The day after my 18th birthday was like any normal Sunday, until a
phone call changed everything. My mom talked fast; she sounded confused and concerned. She then hung up the phone and said with a blank stare, ""Grandma's house is on fire."" A thousand questions ran through my mind; are my grandparents safe? How big is this fire? How did this even happen? My mother, my cousin and I quickly headed to the house to answer these questions.
The entire 45 minute car ride to the hills of Georgetown we were all in state of shock. This house was not just any house; it was my childhood. My grandfather built it himself, large enough to have the whole family there for holidays. This house was everything; it was part of my family.
Finally we arrived, all I could see were fire truck lights and people
standing and staring. Suddenly, I saw my grandmother; I ran to her
while secretly thanking God that she was alive. Even more of a relief,
my grandfather was too. After hours of waiting, the fire had finally
ceased. The entire house destroyed, my grandparents left with nothing.
The next day my whole family dropped everything to help my
grandparents. My aunt took my grandmother to buy simple things that I
usually take for granted. Many family members told us how their work
and neighbors were donating anything they had to help. It was so
surprising how even when the economy is in a downturn, people are still so willing to give. Even more, how my family takes no thought as to stepping in to help. To my family, caring is just instinct.
Although this tragedy has brought great heart ache, I now have a new
sense of pride in being part of this family. I am happy to know that if I'm ever in trouble I will not be alone. My family is everything to me; I have never felt so much comfort, support and love from anything else in the world. Nothing can compare to my family, my family is incredible.
There are situations in life that create set backs and tragedy, but
there is still a point where one realizes this has happened for a
reason. I was devastated to think that the memories and holidays spent
in that house would never be the same, but through it all I am still
thankful. I am so proud and honored to be in a family that cares so
much. I believe I am loved; I believe in family.

091248.txt,Nicole,,Under 18,"Fort Collins, Colorado","December 10, 2010",2010,Don't Make Me Go,brotherhood & friendship;change,"""I need to tell you something."" My dad's voice echoed through the room. I glanced up from my homework and headed into the living room where my dad was sitting, my mom next to him. My brother Ryan walked into the room as well and sat on the floor in front of my dad. 
""What?"" Ryan asked. 
I sat next to Ryan and put my hands on my lap, wondering what could possibly cause my dad to call everyone over here. My dad looked at both of us before sighing. ""Mom and I have talked about this and we don't want to completely catch you by surprise, but when I went to Colorado for that business trip, I was offered another job as a principal."" 
I looked at my dad, shocked. I was halfway through first year of middle school, and I didn't want to move away from all my friends. I turned to Ryan, hoping he would share my thoughts, but he didn't look as upset. Instead, he looked at my dad and said, ""Okay.""
Dad smiled. ""Thank you, Ryan. Taking this job really means a lot to me. It will give me a lot of new opportunities."" He turned to me.  ""What do you say?"" 
Everyone looked at me, and I stared back. The hopeful look on my dad's face told me that if I refused, he'd be disappointed, and we may even move anyway. I sighed. ""Fine,"" I muttered. 
Dad looked relieved. ""Thank you."" He said. I couldn't believe this was happening. I'd always thought we would never move, that we'd always stay in Michigan forever. I would have to give up my house, my fish, the woods in my backyard, everything. This was the house I'd lived in all my life, and I couldn't believe that we were just going to get up and go. I ran to my room, knowing that after this year was over, I'd never see it again.
That summer, we packed everything up and drove to Colorado. When school started, I realized that I would have to get to know new people: something I hadn't needed to do since third grade. When I had lived in Michigan, I'd had lots of friends who had been with me for many years, and the move made me realize that I would have to be a nicer person in order to make friends. 
If I hadn't ever moved, I wouldn't have ever reached out to anyone and made any new friends because I'd already had so many that I didn't feel the need to make any new ones. I wouldn't have learned to reach out more and make new friends and I wouldn't have learned to be a better or friendlier person. Moving made me who I am and changed me for the better because it opened me up to new possibilities and experiences, and this is why I believe that everything happens for a reason.

091253.txt,Sarah,,,"Provo, Utah","December 10, 2010",2010,The Inscrutable Exhortations of My Soul,creativity;education & knowledge,"My teacher said, ""Go home and write an essay about your personal Truth. And let that essay come out of you. Then, it will be true, and I will know you.""
What if it's not that simple?
I've been taking English classes for twelve years now, and I'm pleased to say that I am quite fluent in the language. Not only am I fluent, but I can tell you the difference between ""their,"" ""there,"" and ""they're;"" I know how to properly use a semicolon; and I can identify the overarching implications of tone, theme, diction, and/or syntax in any literary work. Still, no one ever pays me a penny for my thoughts, and when I heard the prompt for the final paper in my Writing and Rhetoric class, I knew that it would prove to be one of the most difficult I had ever been assigned. 
Harnessing these skills, I make a list:
I'm a five-foot-six, brunette, Caucasian teenager. My interests include artichokes, indie music, and good quotes. I've grown up in a standard Christian family, with an average income, in a medium-sized home. I have read both the Harry Potter series and the Twilight series in their entirety, I cry during Jane Austen movies, I sing along to the radio, and I think Brad Pitt is hot. I enjoy hanging out with friends. 
And like most of the five-foot-six, brunette, teenage population, I am trying to be more than mediocre.  
What else is there? Twelve years of English and I have no words. 
Quietly cursing the boundaries of language, I struggle for an outlet. The more I struggle, the more desperate I become, the more I need to express myself. It isn't that I lack inspiration; that isn't the issue. I have read, tasted, heard, smelled, felt, seen, and loved enough of the world to know what I believe in. I can feel it throbbing at my core. But every effort to articulate the inscrutable exhortations of my soul in twelve-point font—or any other point font—leaves me frustrated and speechless.
It's not easy to distinguish oneself in today's world—to rise above the typical, the commonplace, the mundane—and really define one's personal Truth. But it's not impossible. I've seen it. At times I've caught glimpses of it expressed (perhaps ironically) in a photograph on Facebook, in a painting at the Louvre, in the lyrics of a song, and on a stranger's t-shirt. Occasionally a person's own depiction of Truth overlaps with my own, and I whoop and shout to all those around me, ""Yes! That's what I've been trying to say! Now do you understand?"" But instead of congratulating me, those within earshot of my obnoxious outburst just avert their eyes and walk away more quickly.  
I've discovered that the key to finding peace is finding the right medium with which to express oneself.  Like Phyllis down the street with the beautiful garden. She has no husband or children to look after her, but her garden looks like one of Monet's paintings. The watering can is her paintbrush, the seeds her palette, the soil her canvas. Meticulously she mixes all three in perfect proportion, then waits patiently, knowing that within weeks the dull soil will be overwhelmed by the vibrant profusion of colors. 
Like Tom who takes pictures of birds in the park. He uses small words, and sleeps in the back seat of his Honda at night, but with his camera he can make a crow look like an evil sorcerer and a sparrow look like an opera singer and a jay look like the prodigal son. 
Like Stacy who walks to school with me and tells me stories. She is acne-scarred and dresses in hand-me-downs, but with her words she changes all that. In her stories we become wealthy princesses, and our backpacks become solar-powered jet packs, and our short walk becomes a dangerous journey through the jungles of Africa where the world has no hold on us.
The thing about school is that teachers often force their students into a certain medium and ask them to define their existence in 250 words. Or something like that. Then when the dancer and the cartoonist submit below par essays, they are labeled as incompetent and unsophisticated. After twelve years of this, those students begin to wonder if those red marks on their essays are really a measure of their character. After a while, they too become convinced of their incompetence, and they begin to forget—they lose their Truth.
To an extent, I am one of those students. Each year of education, each literary work, each edited essay has brought me closer to an understanding of myself. However, I am still on the hunt for my ideal medium of expression. Some days I think it's writing, others it's music, and some days it might even be tie-dyeing. I am never disheartened because each of my attempts brings me closer to a reconciliation of my existence with the world. If there's one thing I've learned, it's to never stop creating, for I believe we are all artists in some way, and a picture isn't the only thing worth a thousand words. Many things are worth much more.

091410.txt,Sarah,,,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","December 11, 2010",2010,Cans Only,work,"For most people, their first few jobs aren't the most glamorous.  Typically kids start off babysitting, pet sitting, or worse… yard work.  Later they advance to working at Meijers, McDonalds or something similar.  For me, the job between babysitting and being a lifeguard was being a ""Cart Kid.""  Being a Cart Kid literally meant you washed and parked golf carts from the moment you got there after school, until dark. When the golf course was having a slow day, instead of hosing down carts,  I sorted through bags of beer and pop cans.  Separating the returnable cans from the loads of trash that people had thrown into the ""CANS ONLY!!!"" bin, and tossing the appropriate cans into their respectable bins, whether it was Coke, Anhiser Bush, Budweiser, etc.  And when I finished the cart washing and sorting though beer cans, I collected trash from all 18 of holes trash cans. That is after ""picking the range"" for golf balls and you were more or less a moving target for those practicing their swing before teeing off.  By no means was this the coolest job in town.  I was paid $3.40 per hour, but it was earned money and I appreciated it all the same.  My father used to tell me how pleased he was that I was actually out earning money, even when the job wasn't overly fabulous.  
As a result of being a cart kid, I now believe in respecting the people doing the jobs that you don't want to do.
Although I only worked there for a few summers I learned the meaning of an honest day's work, and earning money the hard way.  Ever since I worked as a Cart Kid I have learned to appreciated and respect all of the individuals doing their best to simply make an honest days wage doing undesirable jobs; whether it be the kid restocking the shelves at Harding's, or collecting carts at Meijer.  Never again will I intentionally put items back on the wrong shelves just because I'm too lazy to put it back in its correct location, or leave the shopping carts in the middle of the parking lot for somebody else to take care of.  I clearly remember driving home from swimming practice in high school when Jackie (one of the members of my carpool), pointed at the kid promoting Little Ceasers Pizza and said, ""What a loser!"" I could not have disagreed more. I will never make fun of the kid waving a ""$5.55 Little Ceasers Pizza"" sign; in fact I respect them.  For having the discipline and commitment to do the job that not many would do.  I have come to acknowledge the importance of and respecting of those doing the jobs you or I don't want to do.

091730.txt,Sabrina,,Under 18,"West Melbourne, Florida","December 14, 2010",2010,Life Lesson,community;integrity;morality,"Honesty can mean a variety of thins to different people. To me it means to be fair regardless of the situation. It's one of those lessons that stick with you throughout your entire life. Not only does it keep our society safe, but it helps me feel better about myself when I do the right thing. Peruse reading and you will understand why I feel this way.
 Imagine this, your behind a woman in line at a ATM. You can tell she is in a rush as she frantically dials the number with one hand and with the other she is japing on the phone. After the machine spits her card back at her, she jets to her car. Within seconds she vanishes in the traffic of cars. It's my turn in line, as I put my card into the machine I notice four crisp twenty's on the mouth of the ATM machine. What would you do in a situation like that, take the money or leave it? Of course like any other person in this world, I took it. Not soon after the woman returns hysterical, without thinking twice about it I return the money. The woman praised me about how honest I was.
 When someone is considered honest you usually think of someone that is trustworthy. Focus on this reason, when I was little I constantly blamed my siblings for everything even when I did it.  But you see I would get in more trouble then if I would of just told the truth. So when day I did that exact thing, ends up I didn't in get in trouble. People that actually are honest, can get treated better than by those who lie. 
 Being honest can take in very far in life. No matter the situation, if it's on a job interview or making friends! When you are trying to be an all-American person you think of someone that is honest. And others will look up to you like a toddler looks up to his parents. 
 Finally, honesty us a lesson that everyone should learn. If all people become honest then our society, will be an ideal society. Living in the world these days, is hard enough with out having to lie all the time. There is nothing like honesty and as the saying goes honest is the best policy.

It was me, my cousin Nick, the other Nick, Chad, and all our parents. The four of us went up to Nick's room to play video games, like we always did when we hung out. We loved to play The Matrix video game because we always found ways to make it hysterical. That's all we would ever do; find ways to make each other laugh and laugh for hours; always over the simplest of things too. Our parents used to make fun of how we would find the simplest of things hilarious, but we never cared what they though. The boys always included me in everything; I was one of them. I think that's why I loved to be with them; they never excluded me or made me feel uncomfortable; they were my best friends, my brothers. The times I was with them are my favorite memories because when I was with those three boys I always had the greatest time.
I believe that memories are something we can always look to for comfort and stability. I find memories to be something you can depend on, something that will always be there for you. If you're sad, maybe remembering a happy moment will fix you. When I'm missing Nick, I just think about the memories of how much fun we used to have, and then I feel so blessed to have been friends with such an amazing individual. Nick, Chad, and I are still good friends, and I'm sure they still use the memories we had to remember our departed friend. Memories are there to help you remember the irreplaceable things you have lost. They can also make it hard to erase moments from your life, whether it's an embarrassing moment or someone you want to overlook. A memory is a way of holding onto the things you love, and the things you never want to forget.

That point where you want the pain to go away so badly—that you're willing to take your own life? I think many reached that point, but knowing you have loved ones there to catch you is life's biggest reward.
Growing up I never really fit in school. I was constantly picked on, getting called names. People never really got to know me as a person: they made assumptions based on what they saw of me. The term I always was called was ""gay""; but in reality, that wasn't even true.
As a child, I learned the hard way. I didn't trust people, and I never could trust being friends with or around guys. My older cousin, a male, molested me as a child. He made me do things I didn't want to do: it went on for four years. I didn't tell anyone. My parents moved to a new house and it all stopped. I didn't see my cousin ever, so it helped me get away from the situation to the point where it just stopped.
After that traumatic event affecting my life, I could see that I didn't want to trust anyone that was an older guy for the fear that it would happen again. So I stuck to being friends with girls, and just having one or two guy friends. No one ever really knew why I was doing it, and neither did I, it was a defense mechanism I just had. But by doing so, I gave people the wrong impression, which went through all my early years and teenage years. 
In high school, the problem just got worse. All I heard was people talking about me, saying offensive remarks about me. I couldn't take it. All I remember hearing in my head were those words. And never standing up for myself made it worse. I was getting smacked in the face on the bus, and in school I didn't tell anyone since I didn't want to make things worse. 
One day, as I was getting off the bus, I was ready to end the pain—I was ready to jump in front of the next bus that I saw pass me on my way home. I saw this school bus coming my way and I just jumped forward… until this girl pulled me by my arm; she told me ""STOP! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!"" When I turned around it was my best friend, she was there to console me. 
I never thought that an act of kindness could do that, knowing that someone that cared about me pulled my arm and saved me from my death. That showed me not everyone in the world is looking to screw you over, there are people worth being friends with in this world. Feeling loved by family and friends is the reason I'm still here, that moment I realized if I have those who love me nothing can knock me down.

Sometimes those choices we make are the wrong ones. Through time we realize those mistakes and if we are lucky, and not too stubborn, we find the power to change. While no one seeks to make wrong choices, somehow I always thought I was different, smarter. I wasn't. My police uniform defined me to the extent that it buried my own unique identity. The badge on my chest was my voice. The gun on my hip represented my passion for justice. 
Decisions I made during the early years of my adulthood led me down a road of self-destruction. These choices destroyed my dream. It took seven years of wanting to be a police officer to actually achieve the honor, and only four months for my dreams to shatter. Poor decisions included an abusive boyfriend and later an unwanted pregnancy. I could not take care of myself, and when I became pregnant, I faced my fears of motherhood, especially with the father, whom I feared more. I did not reach out to anyone for help. Ultimately, I became so depressed that I looked down the business end of my duty weapon. I still shiver at the anger, knowing I would never pull the trigger. The only smart choice here was my resignation. There are no words to describe the feeling of un-holstering your gun and feeling that weight lift from your belt. Nor is there any expression to illustrate how cold my badge was when I unpinned it from my chest. Without my badge and gun, I was completely lost and had no purpose. The tears came then and they still come now, just not as often.
Eventually, I faced my mistakes head on by telling my boyfriend about our pregnancy; he walked out. I soon miscarried, which was a blessing in disguise. Then came the unthinkable: the move back in with my parents. I crawled and stumbled a bit but was walking again in a couple of years. I focused on making better choices and rediscovered myself and took advantage of new possibilities: dating, returning to school to finish my degree, and living on my own again. Soon began the process of becoming an officer again. Unfortunately, I faced a lot of department rejections, but on October 31, 2009, I took my new oath.  As I once again recognized my reflection in the mirror, I vowed to remember the person underneath the badge and gun.  After work, the uniform would come off, in more ways than one. Now I'm in a healthy relationship, and enjoy life with my renewed sense of determination.

My life kind of went very pasty from there. I could say a lot of stuff about what I felt, but here are a few words that describe what I felt: scared, lonely, hopeless. What else could I say? I lost the father of my life, the hero of my life, my dad. Things went down hill from there. 
First of all this man I call dad, Carlos, is not my biological father and the woman I call Nana, Kathy, is his wife.  He's my hero because my biological father, Shane, has really never been there for me. My dad Carlos has helped me through school and when I needed help with homework he was always right there to help. When I was turning twelve he came to my birthday party at the Lake Shore Lanes. He stayed to sing happy birthday and sign my bowling pin. He wrote ""Dj Cruz in the house happy birthday"" which was the last thing he had written to me before he died.
There was a day when my mom Sherri and I went up to see him in the hospital. He asked me to pray for him, but I didn't know what to say and I just stood there. I feel still to this day as if I killed him because I didn't pray for him. They say, ""A child's voice is stronger than an adult's.""   That killed me inside when I was told that because I could have saved him possibly if I would have prayed. Sometimes, I can even hear his voice telling me it's not my fault. But I don't listen.
The thought of my little brother not having his biological father there also kills me, because Carlos was there for his two older boys Chris and Mike. He'd go to their football games, baseball games and anything else they had like dances and other activities.
So after Carlos died three years ago I have been on a rocky road. What I learned is that even though this bad, disappointing thing happened to me, I need to move on and get my life back in shape. It doesn't mean I don't have the sadness or once in awhile tears.  It just means that I have understood that he is gone and I can't fix that. But I can fix me and my life and how I take the bad things that happen to me in life and make them good. 
I also can take Carlos's legacy and help with my brother. I know he would want me to as his son's sister. Like me cheering on my brother at his football games or telling him how great his father was as a dad. But for me, changing my life around and getting back on my feet is wonderful! I realize how hard I was on myself; I understand that bad things happen to good people, even me sometimes.
So I believe that when life gets pasty you absolutely can make it wonderfully tasty.

As I ventured five hundred miles down to South Carolina in early August, I didn't have the slightest idea of what to expect of the next year of my life. Knowing only a few people I was ready for anything. My roommate, whom I had met via facebook, was your classic Italian who embraced most of her culture, especially the food. Although I am not from such a strong culture, I too enjoyed a delicious Italian meal.
One of the first nights that Alex and I spent in our room together, I remember turning on the TV and wondering: what are we going to watch? Will we like the same shows? I thought to myself, maybe I should give her the remote and let her make the choice. So I did.  Alex took the remote, and after going through a few channels she picked one. She chose the Food Network. ""The Greatest Thing I Ever Ate"" came on and instantly I glanced at Alex and she glanced at me. Both of us were grinning ear to ear. Was it the talk of the food that made us both so excited? Or was it the idea that we had found our first thing in common? I probably shouldn't make any assumptions, but I believe it would be that it was a combination of both.
After the first few weeks of school I finally began to adjust and establish a group of girlfriends. Despite their tiny figures, they too shared the same love for food. Whether we ate in a nice restaurant, which was usually at the beginning of the month when we had all received the first of our allowance, or eating in the dinning hall, it brought us together. It was an easy way to get to know one another. I believe our love for food was an easy way to ""break -the- ice"". We spent countless hours at meals discussing our lives, allowing us to learn more about one another.
Even though food is so simplistic, I believe it has a way with people.  Food promotes good feeling and comfort. The gathering of flavors in food reminds me of the gathering of people. I believe we focus on the ""flavors"" of others we learn each of our ""delectable"" characteristics.

And I was always acutely aware of the expense I caused my parents. Out of seven children, I was always the one who needed things. I used to wonder, why me? At six it was speech therapy, I had a tongue abnormality. At eight it was braces, I had a jaw deformity. At eleven it was glasses. And last year, at twenty-six, it was heart surgery, I had a heart defect. Actually it was multiple heart surgeries. At this moment in my life; the cardiologist isn't sure of my prognosis. Will I need more heart surgeries? Will I need to be on medication for the rest of my life? Will I die? At first I wanted to be mad at someone. It wasn't fair. But I don't believe in God, and I don't feel like I can blame my parents. (Even though they sometimes blame themselves). Instead I came to a realization. Bad things will happen in my life, and so will good. I can learn from the bad, or not. And I can appreciate the good, or not. Whichever I please. But this I believe. My life will be as good as I want it to be. Or as bad as I allow it to be. My perspective in life determines the type of life I lead. Now sometimes I wonder, why me? And then I think of how much I have changed for the better since my heart surgeries. I'm more aware of social issues and I care about them more. I volunteer. I've taken steps to live a more mindful and environmentally friendly lifestyle. I'm kinder to my friends, family, and strangers. I'm more forgiving. I even tip more. Why me? Well, why not me?

Of course I was crushed, but I learned to love it, having two houses, two Christmases, and after my parents remarried, two sets of parents. My mom married Steve, who is the best person for my mom. He treats her like gold, and they rarely fight. My father, however, married Sandy. At first when they got together, she treated me like i was her own, getting me everything a little girl could ask for. Little did I know that I was the only little girl in her life, She only had four boys. By the time i was ten, she was abusing me. Mentally and Physically, she drained my energy. She hurt me every time I went to my fathers house to visit. I would watch out the window when he picked me up, just to see if she was in the car. I had to know exactly what to do. Exactly where to walk, when to keep my mouth shut, and when to say something to compliment her. When I turned thirteen, I realized I could just get away from it. I thought for sure that my father would listen to me, he would leave her if he knew what she was doing to me. I was always his number one. But when I told someone about it, He left. He took her side, saying that I was raised wrong, raised as a brat, as a selfish manipulative dog. Somewhere in the middle of all that, Sandy had a baby. A sweet baby boy named Logan. He was the only reason I went over there, so i could hear him say ""I wuff you"" one more time, so I could hold him and rock him to sleep. Sandy changed him. I was no longer his sister. she convinced him that he didn't have a sister. that I was just a friend. I had a choice: I could either get away from the pain, live with my mom, or deal with the pain and keep the brother that meant everything to me. I knew I was outsmarted. I couldn't do anything about it until he was older. It was the hardest choice I've had to make, but I chose to get away from the pain. I fought to live with my mom, crying every night about losing the one thing that made my life happy.So, I let go. I moved with my mom, I tried to forget. From time to time, I glance back on the past and remember my baby brother, and i still miss him, but i know it was for the better that i grew up with my mom. I'm fifteen now, and although my past was a mess, my future is clear. I will be successful, and I won't let anyone bring me down. I believe that no matter what bad situations life gives you, there is always a possibility for happiness.

094585.txt,Caterina,,Under 18,"Deltona, Florida","February 11, 2011",2011,Containers of Amazing,values & spirituality,"A container of secrets and amazing sites filled to the brim with personal memories.  A special and infinitely beautiful creation that will exist as another factor of universal entropy.  A body.  A mind.  A spirit.  A human. What I believe in is something that several people are taught, but many often refuse to believe.  My belief comes from having my pre-judgments about people shot down, time and time again.  Seeing how special everyone really is when their eyes light up with passion or when an idea that you or me would have never thought of, pops out of their mouth.  My belief is how I can tolerate that rude cashier or lousy waitress.  I believe, with all of my heart, that each person is beautiful in their own right no matter how they appear to be.  
Throughout my life, I've tried to pick people apart and see how they work.  In every instance that I think I've got someone ""figured out,"" I see an unexpected talent or a unique and shocking view that had never been apparent to me before that moment.  Because of my belief I've felt a flurry of emotions, especially when interacting with others.  I have felt insatiable curiosity and buzzing excitement when I first started to learn about a person, as well as deep love and appreciation for an individual after I have learned more truths about them.  For example, there was a boy I knew who looked to be something he most definitely was not.  This individual seemed apathetic to the world around him, corrupt, rude, and selfish.  As I grew closer to him, however, his true colors started to show.  I learned that he was very sensitive, has a love for strategy games, is extremely naïve, innocent, and is a loyal friend.  Though these things can only be found out through time and a good use of respect and patience, they are very real and often over-looked.  Due to the fact that people do not want to be harmed or let down, they hide who they really are. So it is not always easy or even possible to see their beauty at a first glance…or even a millionth glance. It could take years.
Discovering that each person is brilliant in a sense has affected my behavior drastically. Now instead of taking people at face value, I look for their hidden nuggets of brilliance.  I am more tolerant of offensive behavior and I understand that humans are complex and unpredictable.  We are all exceedingly different like the angle measures of a triangle are all separate and personalized to one angle. But we all create an equal society like how the three measurements in a triangle always equal to 180 degrees.  If others believed in my belief, murder or war would seem inexcusable instead of mildly acceptable.  People would show more compassion and tolerance toward others and accept their differences.  Who knows? They may even grow to love themselves more!
Unless physically unable, every person can react to stimuli. Think in some way, feel in some way, and affect others in some way.  We each live separate, unique, personal lives that form totally different personalities.  I believe that this gives us an inner and sometimes outer beauty that is immeasurable.  In the future I will continue to advocate my belief in other's beauty through my behavior towards them.  My belief may be a form of somewhat blind generalization but I think that understanding the talents a human being can hold in their mind or body is an important part of maintaining a positive and efficient lifestyle.

Other days, they are as hazy as the fog that settles upon my house each winter morning. On these days I have to wonder to myself why are they so hazy? Do I choose to forget them, or do they simply become less and less important. I believe in second chances. Not the ones granted by others out of love or pity, but the ones your grant yourself out of respect and determination. 
A few years ago I had to make the tough transition from elementary school into middle school. Suddenly, all the people I had spent my life growing up with were gone, divided into new social cliques, and nowhere to be seen. I carried one friend with me through the rough transition. My mom knew she was trouble from the moment she met her. However, I refused to believe she was anything less than a good person. I was later proved wrong when her drug addict mother came back into the picture and took her daughter down with her. This is just one of the many examples of the kind of people I spent my time with.
At the end of sixth grade I was introduced into the practice of cutting from reading Chicken Noodle Soup for the Teenage Soul II. At the time I felt as if maybe I tried this new thing, I wouldn't feel so helpless. This habit followed me through the rest of elementary school and on into middle school, where my world had been shaken up once again. I found myself hanging out with the wrong people, got introduced to several more bad habits, and started flunking every class but band. By the second trimester I was a mess. I hated who I had become but had no idea how to get out. 
Approaching the end of that trimester I once cutting regularly, lying to my parents, and hoping just to die, thinking everyone would be better off without me. Needless to say, I was severely depressed. The school counselor had recommended to my parents to seek counseling, which didn't ever help much. Coming upon spring break I had had enough. In a moment of pure despair I found a bottle of pills and took as many as I had the strength to swallow. Next, I found myself dialing the suicide prevention hotline, who called an ambulance to my house. I soon found myself in the emergency room of the hospital and later in the Adolescent Psychiatric Ward at Providence Hospital. Here I spent a week of my life hating myself even more. I wanted nothing to do with anyone. Eventually, I found a salvation in art, the feeling of getting my hands dirty, and finding out that I wasn't alone in my disease. 
Shortly after my release I went to more counseling and came to find out which illnesses I was battling- depression, anxiety disorder, PTSD, and even minor accounts of bipolar. Determined to fight the monster on my own, I refused drugs. Instead, I found refuge in art and God. I spent a few nights a week at church, participated in missions trips, and improved my drawing skills. I came to realize my strengths and battled every monster I was put face to face with. 
Today, I am a 4.0 student, enjoy spending time with people, and recognize my own self worth. I believe in second chances. Not the ones granted by others out of love or pity, but the ones you grant yourself out of respect and determination. Some days I still find the battle to be an ongoing one, but I know that I will always win. I gave myself a second chance to be someone new and I didn't let myself down. I'm a stronger person now and one day hope to be able to teach my method to others through a career as a psychologist. I believe that every second chance can change the world.

094761.txt,James,,Under 18,"Vernon, New Jersey","February 14, 2011",2011,Believe It,self-determination;self-knowledge,"I believe in many positive ideas in life.  I think the most important one believes in pride.   Pride is so important in life because without it you lose all confidence.  No matter what the situation is, no one should be ashamed of decisions or situations they may participate in.  If it is not present then the action will most likely be unsuccessful until you find pride in yourself.  Every successful action is done with pride and confidence.
For example, many students in high school do not have pride in their school work.  Most kids think that if they raise their hand and answer questions then they will be considered a nerd or a geek.  Since no pride is shown in school work many kids are failing and having to take classes over in school.  The kids that do show pride in work will do excellent and excel in classes.  If pride is shown than adults will consider you a whole different person.  More options will be available in life and activity that some people can not do.  In my school sports require a certain average you have to maintain.  Therefore, many school require a grade of a ""C"" or higher.  If that grade is not maintained then the student can not participate in that sport.  Also schools give awards to students who have exceptionally high grades such as honor roll or the presidential award.  The rewards create more confidence and make students aware that they can achieve and believe in themselves.  I always have pride in school work and anything that comes my way because it benefits me somehow and sometimes gives great awards.
Pride is very important the believe in.  With pride come confidence and those qualities are the most important in life.  Believing in yourself will lead to great outcomes from your decisions and situations.  Everyone should believe in pride, because no one should be ashamed or disappointed of what they do.  When I make an important decision or I am in an important situation, I believe in myself and I almost succeed every time.  I believe in pride.

094824.txt,Kaitlin ,,,"Danielsville, Pennsylvania","February 15, 2011",2011,My Values and Ethics,integrity;respect;values & spirituality,"Honesty is the best medicine. Act in a professional manner to show your strengths and the type of person you are. To get respect you need to give respect. These common phrases were taught to me at a young age and I still hold close to them in all that I do today. It made me the person I am. These phrases form a great parallelism to many of the values and ethics in todays' NASW integrity, competence, and dignity and worth.  
Integrity or in other words being honest is sometimes hard to accomplish. Our very government finds this characteristic to be important though for it is used in our very court system. In the beginning of any proceeding there is an oath one must say and it goes ""Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God"" when you swear to this oath you are swearing with god as your witness. This connection is made because your hand is placed on the bible while saying the oath back to the court. With honesty being the best medicine I feel that it is. I as a person do not want only part of the picture but the whole so I have a better understanding on how to handle things that come my way.  I have found it difficult though to trust others with honesty being the biggest factor in that trust.  I have been hurt with the fabricated lies some have chosen to tell me. Where if they were honest from the beginning, yes I still would have been hurt but not as hurt and affected by it now. When things are done to you often find it in yourself to be the opposite of what you were given. I am a product of that.  I have made it a point to be honest with others even if that honesty negatively affects me at the end of the day. My very competence is shown within my integrity. 
On a day to day basis I strive to increase my professional knowledge and skills so I am able to at the end of the day apply them to my very life and help me become a better individual within this society. The competence of oneself is highly looked upon especially in today's society, examples of that are in the work force, when it comes to choosing a partner on a group project, and there are many others. My competence is driven solely by the fact that I want to be as knowledgeable as possible and be a leader. Competence alone can make someone into a leader. I practice this in my own life because why would I want to follow others, when I can set the path myself. In setting that path for myself I need to also follow through with respecting others and their choices as well. 
I have been told by most of my family that if I had to I would give my left butt cheek to someone if they really needed it. My compassion for others and sustaining healthy relationships with them is a huge part of who I am. Although there are many times where I have been walked all over by other people for this it has not changed that quality in me. Along with dignity and worth there is also the theme of respect.  When I respect someone I respect them for who they are as a whole and not just part of them. 
Integrity, Competence, and Dignity and Worth are what I believe. I try my best to make it apparent in my own life and advocate for it as best as I can. These very values and ethics are the frame work that I as an individual was built on and taught by my parents and This is What I Believe.

Even though people are staring at me in the halls and looking at me like I was crazy, I know I made the right decision. I am not doing anything wrong.

emotional experience, but rather from an all consuming desire to distinguish what
was a reality,from what was not.
        I believe that I exist. I believe that there is a reality, an absolute. I believe
that it is essential that I be able to distinguish between what is reality and what
is not. I believe it is possible for mankind to know what the realities surrounding
them are;even though the realities may not be understood in thier completeness.
        I believe that if faith is baised on a reality even if that reality is not understood in its completness; it would still be logical to have faith. Some realites can onlybe observed by how they affect other realities,gravity for instance.
       I believe in a starting force, a creator of life and mankind.I believe it is true that mankind has embraced the supernatural because ofa psycological need, but I believe they feel that need because it is how they were designed.
       I believe that there is code of morality.I believe that the line of good and
evil runs down through the center of us all.
       I believe that man is a product of how he chooses to respond to his environment. God has given man free will.
       I believe that God is good. People point to the pain and brokeness of the world as proof that God could not exist. I believe that the brokeness is simpy
evidence of what happens when man does not live as God intended him to.
       I believe in Christianity.I find it compelling that the Jews,Christians, and
Muslims, all consider the Torah a holy book.
       I believe that Jesus was the son of God. Jesus said that love was the greatest commandment. I believe that true selfless love is the answer to many
of todays problems.
       I do not expect you to accept what I say at face value. I believe people can
effectively build a logical support for anything they choose to believe. I believe
that logic is not always truth,and feeling is not always fact.While logic and feeling are mans two greatest ways of knowing; they are also
his greatest weakness.
       I believe in order to know the truth a man must be willing to sacrifice everything for it. I believe we often have erroneous beliefs about reality because
we have motives for not wanting that reality to be. 
      I believe that God will reveal truth to the sincear truth seeker. I believe that
God is truth.
      I believe that in this life we will never be able to come up with a logical train
of thought that proves,beyond a cynics attack, that God is.
      I believe that if a cyinic were honest in his cynicism he would not stay a cynic for long. To be consistent in his cynicism he would need to be skeptical
of his own cynical outlook.
      I believe that overall that the Christian worldview aswers humanities questions in a way that is more complete than any other.

095200.txt,Cecily,,,"Columbus, Ohio","February 24, 2011",2011,Mental Illness,empathy & compassion;illness,"I believe mental illness is looked upon as a poor, unintellectual, or evil man's disease, because of the things the mentally ill may say or do that seem violent in nature. For instance, a person may ask another person, ""What are you looking at?"" The mentally ill person may feel paranoid and that somebody may be after them, so they may go after them first, maybe in a violent nature. The mentally ill have what is called a ""chemical imbalance"" and if they are not on their meds or are in a crisis state, yes, I believe in this instance violence can and will occur.
I believe we have in our minds, even among the mentally ill, what mental illness looks like, smells like, acts like, and perhaps may feel like. I have been made fun of because I've worn a coat in warm weather. I wouldn't even think about it. I just would feel a little cold or chilly and I might put on a heavy jacket. I can remember my grandmother saying ""Something's wrong with you, you wear a coat when you don't need one and when you need one you don't wear one."" How could she tell me if I needed a coat or not. Aren't our body temperatures different?
I've been called ""crazy"" by family members and friends that didn't understand me or didn't care to. I've been called crazy by people on the streets. I may have frowned or gotten upset and said a snide remark, and someone might say, ""You know what, you're crazy""! I've been told by people that didn't know me on the streets, ""Take your meds"" because I may have snapped on someone quickly.
Ever since I was a child I've felt crazy. Is crazy a feeling? How does one feel crazy? I tell you I always felt like I stuck out like a sore thumb. I felt unintellectual in high school because I made low grades. I figured something must be wrong with me. I wasn't diagnosed with mental illness until in my twenties: I just thought I was targeted by the devil and his demons. It never occurred to me anything about having a mental illness. 
I was being stereotyped before I was even diagnosed as mentally ill. I could remember walking into a store or going into the public and feeling like everyone had zoomed in on me at once. I felt in essence, then, that society saw me in a certain way. Then when in 1999, I was labeled a ""menace to society"" by Net Care staff, a mental health outpatient facility, that supposedly helps people with mental illnesses in crisis. I was convinced. I had no family to check up on me and support me in this. I was talking about demons and the devil and everybody was scared of me.
I believe some of the most intelligent people are those with mental health issues such as bipolar, schizophrenia, and many others that I haven't mentioned. However, a lot of times these people get passed by or looked over by society and this system. I believe it is going to take those with mental health issues to communicate. I wish it was possible for a ""normal"" person to take a walk in the day of the life of the mentally ill person, and see how it feels to be labeled as mentally ill, A.K.A ""crazy."" I have walked down the street and been insulted by the stares, jeers, and sneers of people standing around with nothing to do. There is even stereotyping between the mentally ill. There's crazy, plain crazy and real crazy for those that may not be severe. Some may look down on someone that may be talking to themselves or hollering profusely. This can scare anyone.
It's going to take brutal honesty from the mentally ill as well as the government to correct this national problem or it may become a national disaster. I say this because people can only take so much, and the mentally ill population is being ignored and treated as though they are incapable of being given the same opportunities or rights as the ""norm."" When people have taken all they can take, murders begin to happen, violence starts occurring in the community of the mentally ill, and misunderstandings will begin to take place. Pretty soon around the world we will have a phenomenon on our hands of a displaced people wanting vengeance.
Anytime you are dealing with men, women, and children who have been traumatized and as a result have become mentally Ill, without the proper treatment, some can become out of control. This leads to misunderstandings in the community amongst the so called ""normal; however, they should heed the warnings and take the issues at hand more seriously. There's a reason why a young man is a pedophile, and a rapist, and cuts him self all in the same breath. But, yet, he's locked away in prison, put on meds that don't work, and is ignored. So, what will be done about this phenomenon? In the case of a state of emergency in the mental health system, we better be ready and aware of the problems at hand.

095308.txt,Hannah ,,Under 18,"Roswell, Georgia","February 28, 2011",2011,Contentment,Christianity;peace,"I believe the root of happiness is contentment.  Swami Sivananda  has stated, ""There is no end of craving. Hence, contentment alone is the best way to happiness. Therefore, acquire contentment.""  Contentment is not based on our circumstances, but rather, it is a state of mind. Some attempt to acquire satisfaction through material means, others are seeking gratification through their relationships, and some are trying to find contentment on a spiritual level. People try to fill this void in countless ways. Personally, I find true contentment in Jesus. It is through Jesus that I know God intimately and it is in Him that real contentment lies for me. I look forward each summer to my annual youth group retreat in Pennsylvania. From the worship, teachings and friends I find myself examining the past year. Life has good times and bad times and if we have contentment life is a lot less hectic. 
Have you ever met a three year old who always wants more and is given more and more each time he asks?  There is a good chance he will never feel satisfied. Life is such a gift, and because we are so spoiled here in America, we take a lot for granted. Many of us thank God before eating a meal and we ask God to use the food we are eating to nourish our bodies, but most of us have never actually prayed for food to eat. We simply take that for granted. We assume there will be food in our grocery stores and that we will have the finances to purchase it. On the contrary, the children of Israel prayed for manna to eat while walking through the desert. Contentment for them was only found in God and His provision.
Now, have you ever met a genuinely happy person? They usually are content people who trust God and take life as it should be taken, as a gift. In the Bible, Romans 12:12a says ""Base your happiness on your hope in Christ."" I have a friend who is a friend to everyone she meets, and she is content with her life. She lives every day purposefully trying to share the love of Christ with others. I consider her a role model, and she has been a great influence in my life. Contentment is a great quality, and if everyone walked in true contentment, our world would be a much better place.

Other times I want to snuggle with them and love them forever. My mom's name is Leslie and she adopted me from China. My sister, Meng Li, is 22 months younger then me. She was also adopted from China. 
It all started when my family moved into a new and bigger house. My sister and I shared a room. Each night my mom would come into our room and tell us a story. My sister always wanted to hear a story about Leslie's childhood, while I wanted to hear a story about James Bond my mom's kid friendly version. Since we didn't like each others stories we took turns. Each night we would switch off the type of story. Whoever's turn it was who got to choose a story got a back massage or back scratch while hearing the story.  As time went on I got older and so did my sister. We soon had different rooms hers pink and mine blue. We still had stories but I got the odd days and my sister got even days. 
One time it was Meng Li's night. I was awake reading a book. It was around 9:00 and my mom was going to turn off my light. Then I asked her, ""Can you come up in my bed?"" She though about it then said, ""Yes."" As I waited for her to take hers pills and do her business I thought, ""Really,? She is really going to come up here even thought it's not my night?"" When she came up I made room for her with my stuffed animals. Having only a bunk bed it was a tight squeeze. I would feel like a bug being squashed by a big human. She massaged and scratched my back for a while then she told me one of her famous James Bond stories. The sound from her words when through my ears like the wind remembering the soft sound. The rest of the night I slept with good dreams.
Now when I am very mad at my family I think back to this wonderful action my mom did for me. From now on I carry the belief of family love. My mom still occasionally gives me an extra story, but that was one night I will remember forever.

The ones who look on brighter side of things. Yes, the world is bursting with clichés, drama, stress, and so on… but is that really all it has to offer? We're all human, making many mistakes in a lifetime; however everyone needs to move beyond the depressing, sorrowful, shocking, or even embarrassing events that have occurred in their past years. They need to focus on what's virtuous in their own lives and live the life they've continuously imagined.  I believe in moving forward. In life, in bad experiences, and merely on a day to day basis. 
        This past March I was in a car accident. It was nothing extreme, but an actual, traumatizing, car accident. My sister was driving us home from our aunt's house when someone smashed into the side of ours car's rear end. We spun and ended up looking like we parallel parked facing the wrong direction. Phone calls were being made, and I was not able to comprehend what had happened in those past few seconds. Even though the airbags in our car went off, they did not in the significantly smaller vehicle, which looked like an accordion. Thankfully, none of the individuals involved in the accident were severely injured. The excruciating power from the airbag made me the only one to receive a minor abrasion.  
        My life was then put on hold.
        Weeks after the accident, my sister and I were afraid to move on, and afraid to drive back down that road. We stayed strong, but whenever we passed side streets, we would give it a glance or look away. If there was a car there, my sister would hesitate passing. I was afraid of learning to drive. Worried about if I ever were to get into an accident, what the outcome would be. I eventually did get into a car and start driving, and shockingly, I enjoyed being in control of the car itself. I urged myslef to forget the past, knowing i did someday have to get in a car,fearless.
I had moved on from what I thought haunted me, while my sister gradually moved forward, and away from her own fear of side streets. The stress and uncertainties the accident caused slowly left my mind. It made me realize we should accomplish our goals and simply focus on our idyllic memories. Getting a license was a goal of my own. My sister drove us to school every morning, as well as other places she needed to be since the accident.
        Within seconds anything can happen in your life. Car accidents, the loss of a friend…anything. Moving forward in your life is the only way to relieve yourself of the pain, the shock, or the anger that's been straining your hectic mind. Your life shouldn't be put on hold because of one single event, or various events. Less would be accomplished because of worries and fear.  In order to let your future live and change, it is critical that you move forward, away from your past, having hope.

096021.txt,Kori,,,"Owings Mills, Maryland","March 14, 2011",2011,My Family Tradition,family;legacy;sports,"I can close my eyes and can still picture my first lacrosse game. It was a Saturday afternoon in September, a warm sunny day; my whole family was there watching. During, the second half of the game, I scored my very first goal, and I remember looking back to my father and grandfather and the picture on their face was priceless. I saw a look of pride and happiness in their faces and they were so proud of me. That day in September of 1996 was the day that I fell in love with game of lacrosse; I fell in love with every aspect from the practice to the games to shopping for new equipment. My father and grandfather passed on their love of the game to me, I believe in family traditions.
Every person in my family has played lacrosse, it may have only been for a season or two, or like myself it's been my entire life. It is more than just a sport to my family; it's a family tradition that brings us closer and closer every day. My father, grandfather, and uncle have all played for the University of Maryland, we go down there for games occasionally and wear their old jerseys in pride. This is our family tradition; we all enjoy every aspect of a simple lacrosse game. I cannot even think of a single-family event that doesn't revolve around the game. 
Now as a college student I don't get to play as often as I'd like, I don't play for my college team simply because I don't want to. I coach young girls who are just starting out at playing this sport and it makes me smile every Saturday morning when I have a game and one of my girls scores; I look back at their parents face and I see my parents and how excited they were when I scored my first goal. Those cold Saturday mornings at 9 am when I'd rather be sleeping off the hangover from the night before, that is the love and excitement I live for. 
I believe everyone should experience running around on cold Saturday morning at on a muddy field [throwing a ball into a net?]. Once you have experienced that, you have felt part of my family tradition and the love that we put in to such a simple thing. I believe in family traditions, and that everyone should have this much love and energy poured into a family tradition that is as simple as a sport.

096191.txt,Willa,,Under 18,"Seattle, Washington","March 18, 2011",2011,I believe in roller coasters,courage;fear;self-determination,"I hate roller coasters. Well, at least I used to. Just watching people ride them made my stomach tie up in knots. Even thinking about it makes my heart start to race double time. I envy the people more courageous that I, who squeeze into the cramped leather seats with the rubber-coated bar in front of them. The ones who laugh and scream as they zoom past at top speeds. I never would have thought the day I would be one of those people would come this soon.
I was at the water park with my two friends, at the foot of an enormous old looking wooden roller coaster. They called it ""The Timberhawk"". The sparkle in my friends' eyes, and the grin on their faces told me that they were going on this one, too.  A sigh of exasperation escaped my lips. They had gone on most of the roller coasters and  other scary rides in this park, and I was tired of waiting for them on the sides. They had tried persuading me into each and every ride they had ridden, but the answer was always the same. 
This time, however, they somehow managed to talk me into riding this monstrous looking roller coaster. I regretted my answer as soon as I spoke it, but it was too late to go back. They already had me by the elbows, and were dragging me up the stairs.  What had I gotten myself into?
 I walked up the creaky wooden stairs with my stomach in my mouth. I took some deep breaths, and I realized I became more and more nervous every step I took.  As soon as we got to the top, the man ushered me into the middle car next to my friend. The one I was informed was the least terrifying. 
We were sitting there for a few seconds, waiting for all of the passengers to load, but then, suddenly, we took off as fast as lightning. It was even faster than it looks when you're watching. Our backs were pressed against the seats and our hair flew back while we sped through numerous jerks and turns. I was finally getting used to the surprise of the small drops and the tight corners when just then, we started to go slowly up the steep, rickety incline. ""Chug, chug, chug, chug"" is all I heard while the anticipation of the steep drop ahead set in all of out minds and Adrenaline flew through our blood. The top of the tracks finally appeared. We stopped at the very tippy top and dropped. We went  Faster and faster, and I was completely terrified. I could have sworn my insides disappeared completely for the few seconds that it felt like I was falling from the sky. 
The ride had ended soon after, and I was scared out of my mind. I couldn't tell completely if I had liked it or not. They asked me if I wanted to go again. I quickly said no. That was enough for one day. I was jittery, and shocked, but I was so proud of myself, and felt so accomplished, because I had faced my fears, and done something I now was going to be scary. The shaking was starting to stop, and reality was starting to set back into place. This had been an interesting day.

096689.txt,William,,Under 18,"Pleasanton, California","April 1, 2011",2011,Oceans of Trash,environment,"Death. Destruction. These two words describe our oceans today. We use 75% of Mother Earth to dump our trash. People do this because, they say, we need to get rid of waste. Sometimes I wonder what they mean by waste. I wonder if they mean trash, the innocent animals, or both. This, I believe, has gone far beyond animal cruelty and getting rid of waste.
Imagine that you're a fish swimming through a breathtaking underwater habitat. You're swimming by a school of carp when a plastic ring goes around your neck and you start to suffocate. Every day, thousands upon thousands of fish are killed in this manner. Sharks get caught in ghost nets that we called waste. Sea turtles get impaled through the head by broken fishing hooks. Broken bottles cut through fish. Dolphins and whales blowholes get jammed by grocery bags and large bags of trash. Everyday sea life is killed by a piece of trash that humans threw into deep waters. Just let me ask: ""What would you do if you lived in the ocean?""
I wonder what our world would be like with oceans of trash. We dump more than 10 times the amount of trash that we throw in dumps, in the ocean. We dump first-aid materials that still have traces of diseases such as AIDS. Surfers and fishermen catch these diseases and bring them back home causing even more problems. In the future we might even need to wear gasmasks to the beach so we don't smell the pollution or catch a disease. This will happen if we keep dumping trash in the ocean. It doesn't sound very fun does it? Our situation seems hopeless doesn't it? But there are steps that we can take to avoid this tragedy.
Listen up! We can avoid making a world full of trash! People can pick up trash at beaches, lakes, and rivers. People have to make sure that their trash doesn't go into the ocean. Sometimes people are careless and forgetful. We'll drop some trash and leave it there to be picked up by someone else. It never will get picked up. We can't be these people anymore. If we continue to be careless we'll live in a definite world of pollution. So pick up trash as often as possible. Volunteer at beach clean-ups. Every person can do their part in cleaning up our world.
Our position hasn't gotten so bad yet. But that won't last forever. This causes us to be blind sometimes. But we need to clean up our oceans and beaches. Not just for ourselves, but for the world and the many species that inhabit it. Parents and teachers think about us kids. What kind of world do you want us to live in? Animal lovers, think about the fish, mammals and other species that live in the ocean. We don't want them to die because of a piece of trash. Kids, what kind of world do you want for yourselves? A world of filth and pollution? Or a clean, beautiful one? We choose our own destiny. We make our future. This, I believe, is something that the human race should do something about for the sake of our world.

097144.txt,Taneris,,,"Aiken, South Carolina","April 12, 2011",2011,Education,education & knowledge;self-determination,"In the Fall of 2007, I made one of the biggest decisions of my life up until that point; I made the decision to go to college.  The way I chose the college to attend is a totally different story, but my decision to attend college was a good one no matter how it came about.  Soon after high school graduation, I embarked on my journey of making class schedules, getting rooms assignments, and interacting with other students.  This was quite different for me because growing up in a small town like mine, you know the same people throughout your entire life.  I heard older students say things like, ""Get involved. It's a good way to meet people.""  Then, I thought to myself and I realized that all of the people that were telling me to get involved had been here way past their time.  Don't get me wrong; getting involved is a good thing, but there is such a thing as being too involved.
I paid their advice no mind and hung with the few friends that came from my hometown.  I met a number of different people through my friends and by attending class.  I am typically a quiet person, but once you get the chance to sit down and get to know me, you see that I am really laid back and down to earth.  The semester went by pretty fast and before I knew it, grades were out.
In high school, I was a solid B student; I never met a class that was too much for me to handle.  However, when I got my grades from my first semester, I was shocked.  I did horribly and so did a number of my friends.  If you would have seen my GPA, you probably would have dropped out of college.  Being the person that I am, I didn't take that route; I had to prove it to myself that I deserved to be here.  So that next semester came around and what do you know I made all B's.  
The moral of this story is to never give up.  There are going to be many times in your life where you come up against obstacles, but don't let them over come you.  If at first you don't succeed, try again.

097287.txt,Jessica,,,"Mastic, New York","April 14, 2011",2011,I Believe in Disrupting My Comfort Zone,courage,"I believe in disrupting my comfort zone – maybe it's a good thing, maybe it's not. I suppose I thrive on stressing myself out over stupid daily activities, and jumping at just about anything to get more experience and grow from it. For example I get sick of a job, do I look at what I am interested in- No, I look at anything: newspaper articles, apply to every store in a strip mall or outlet, call around, or even pick up a second job to torture myself a little more. I never thought of it until now maybe it's because I love money, maybe it's because I need to keep myself busy and not spend money, or is it because I simply want a certain job experience on my resume. Without going outside of our comfort zone what life would we live? How would we experience anything? I believe everyone has different limits on their comfort and that's what makes the different fields in careers and life. I strive to burst more out of my boundaries and do everything I dream of: be a beautician, a kindergarten teacher, a sonogram technician, a tattoo artist and possibly a known artist. Sure not all of that will happen it's a good possibility over time. My comfort zone is: having a home, a family, a stable career, spending less time in the books and more time making the money. Without disrupting my comfort zone I might as well not be living. What's living unless you make the most out of it?

097508.txt,James,,,"Wichita, Kansas","April 21, 2011",2011,I Must Give Back,addiction;charity & service;self-knowledge,"This I believe, that giving back is one of the most important ways for me to grow personally, emotionally, and spiritually. 
               I hear it all the time. Give back. Serve. In church I hear it. In 12-Step meetings I hear it. I hear. I believe. I give back, I have to, because my giving helps other people and that helps me.
Giving back is such a foreign concept to an ex-con recovering from drug addiction. I've lived most of my 38 years as a selfish person doing nothing but taking. However, once I decided to salvage what time I have left and get my life back on track I was amazed at the lengths that others would go to to help me out. It was a little strange at first these strangers going out of their way for a man like me. What I didn't understand then that I'm beginning to understand now, is that the rewards they were receiving for themselves far outweigh anything I received from their help. I like to say that they were selfishly giving unselfishly of themselves. What a beautiful thing that is.
Nothing that I've done for anyone up to this point in my new life has driven this idea home for me as much as what I experienced two weeks ago. I was volunteering as a greeter for my church during a soft launch for an outreach program that will be starting soon. I unexpectedly found myself in a conversation with a 15 year old boy. It was amazing how much he reminded me of myself at his age. He's in trouble at home and school. He's starting to experiment with drugs. He's scared and confused. This kid needed some kind of help from someone right then and there. All I could offer this him was my testimony. A simple story of where I came from, what I did, and what I'm trying to do to clean up the mess I've made of my life. 
                 I connected with this young man and showed him that he's not alone. A nonjudgmental conversation was what he needed and his attitude changed noticeably. He knows he can call on me whenever he needs an understanding ear or advice. Will it stick? Did our talk cause him to choose a different path than the one he is on? I don't know. All I can do is hope that he'll contact me if he needs to. All I know is that because of our talk, I went home that day a better man having been blessed by the smile of a troubled teen. I now know that I can help others avoid the path I've taken and I feel that I am finally doing what is right. Giving back was as easy as talking. That's what I believe.

097667.txt,Alec,,,"Mount Airy, Maryland","April 25, 2011",2011,Why,,"I find it rather difficult to pick out one word to deem as my favorite.  Certainly, the first ones that come to mind are the ones that are fun to say: caribou or conducive, for example.  Such words seem to have a certain satisfaction about them as they roll off the tongue.  But upon consideration of the actual meanings of the words we use in our language, I believe that the word ""because"" is quite possibly the most useful, yet underrated, word, in the English language.  
No, it is not particularly fun to say.  I do not even find it very pleasing to look at.  But the way it is used is quite remarkable.  ""Because"" is the most simple way we can add reasoning and insight into a sentence.  Simply saying ""The dog ran away"" does not tell us much, but if one were to say ""The dog ran away because the gate was left open,"" suddenly we have added an analysis of the situation.  We have thought into the causes and explanations for the event, and defined the catalyst to the occurrence of the dog escaping.  Obviously, this example is almost foolishly simple, but it shows the basic effect of the word ""because"" in any line of thinking.  
Using ""because"" is useful in science, allowing us to label everyday events with scientific explanations.  ""Because"" is useful in psychology, allowing us to label our everyday actions with behavioral explanations.  Anytime we follow a statement with the word ""because,"" we are forced to look into the causes and deeper meanings of that statement.  
But perhaps one of the most intriguing characteristics of ""because"" is that when used alone, it can mean just the opposite.  If someone has absolutely no inclination as to why they want to do something or why something happened, a common phrase is ""Just because.""  One of my favorite quotes of all time is from George Mallory, a famous mountaineer.  When someone asked him why he wanted to climb Mt. Everest, he replied, ""Because it is there.""  This quote seems silly and meaningless at first, but I have thought about it awhile and I believe I have deciphered its message: You do not always need a reason for wanting something in life; the important thing is that you go out and get it.  I could not agree more with this concept.  
The word ""because"" is such a brilliant word because it can give us answers and meaning when we want it to, and completely disregard reason and explanation when we wish to keep things simple.

097884.txt,Jocelyn,,,"Roanoke, Virginia","April 28, 2011",2011,Thoughts Create Our  Reality,self-determination;self-knowledge,"I believe that thoughts are powerful.  Our thoughts create our reality. I have gradually learned that the only thing I have control over is my thoughts. I went to a lecture at Hollins College, speaking was the CEO of Starbucks. He shared about ethical code, and his personal mission statement. I had an ""Aha"" moment when I heard him share about negative thoughts and how he used his mind to control those thoughts. He would say ""I hear you but I don't have time for you."" I believe that I can use my mind to do this very same thing. It was comforting to hear that it is natural to have negative thoughts because I had seen a video called The Secret that stressed succeeding with positive thoughts. Now I have a tool to deal with my negative thoughts by politely acknowledging them but stating that I simply don't have time for them. And it has helped me use my energy not a negative way but in a positive way. 
I went through a period of intense anxiety that I really didn't know where it came from or what triggered it. I was talking with someone who I respected, and they clearly stated that anxiety was just the lack of self discipline in controlling your mind and thoughts. Well that seemed easy enough but they said that this was one of the disciplines that in order to train your mind required the desire, drive and motivation to change. No one can make anyone else change only can an individual change if they want to. I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason, and in order to grow and advance you have to be open to change. I realized if I did not conquer self I would be conquered by self. 
 Shortly after, a dear friend handed me a book to read. Napoleon Hill's book ""Think and Grow Rich"" appeared in my hands. I picked a random spot and opened the book to the chapter of the six fears.  As I read through the fears, I would say oh fear of poverty not me, fear of death not me and then all the sudden I was nodding my head and going yes, yes, yes.. the Fear of Criticism. It was so powerful it was if it jumped off the page and slapped me in the face. My fear of being wrong or not doing the right thing , saying the right thing, walking the right way, dressing the right way, driving the right car, living in the right house, having the right friends, just plan being myself…..Gee Wizzz how much energy am I going to waste on these fears? So then from that moment on I took a step back and stared to evaluate and listen and learn as much as I possibly could. In this chapter is stated what the fear of criticism strips you of and one thing was your creativity and imagination which is so important and prevalent in my life. How could I allow a fear to strip me of my very being? I realize before I can start controlling the conditions around me I must first learn to control myself. Now that I have made this part of my belief system, when negative thoughts come into my head it's as though I immediately acknowledge them and move on. I believe in the power of my thoughts and my ability to control them.

098666.txt,Tylot,,,"Elkhart, Indiana","May 10, 2011",2011,Love,love,"Love is a four letter word that has a huge meaning but in my opinion it is the most unappreciated word known to man. Love is a profoundly tender, passionate affection for another person (dictionary. references). The word love ultimately is a word that should be used only if truly meant. Today, I see more and more teens that enter a relationship and then within the first couple weeks they already say that there in love but after a month they break up. In this essay I will explain how I truly believe in the word ""love"" being over used. 
Seems that as I see more and more young couples getting together, that they want to rush into a relationship and then say love. Love is a very complicated subject that is needed to be thought of more in depth. Love is a very complicated subject that only with enough maturity can be fully understood. There is much to be comprehended when trying to understand love. Realize that there is truly no love at first site that it is only lust at first, but that it can grow into love between to people over time. 
Love is something that is projected towards one another. I feel that to say you love someone is to say that you need the person in your life throughout time and that if you truly love the person you say that you love then you and the person should never break up. I feel that if you do separate that it wasn't meant to be to begin with. Realize that just because you're happy with one particular person doesn't mean that you're in love. Love and happiness are emotions that one feels. Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference but ultimately that is one huge difference that makes it easy to tell the difference between each emotion. The main difference is that in the real world you are the main one to depend on to make yourself truly happy and that love it takes to people to understand what love truly is. 
In today culture, we as Americans see certain things that happen constantly or hear an over usage of one particular word. I believe that the word ""love"" is the smallest word with the biggest meaning. The word love is ultimately the emotions and the way you feel towards a person. To me, it seems like I hear more people using the word without knowing what's truly behind the meaning. I hope that one day, people will think about what loving something, let alone someone, truly consists of and not just say it to make the other person feel like they are needed without knowing that they person that said it is only trying to make the situation better by pretending.

The game provided the nutrient rich soil my roots needed to become strong, enabling me to grow as a person. It taught me dedication; it was the foundation of my motivation-based attitude; it made me discipline myself. Looking back, I see myself with a ball in my hands and sneakers laced tightly to my feet.

Even when I'm not exercising, the sides of my sneakers are there to hold me tight and comfort me, to make trekking around school a little easier that day. A somber me is easily cheered by a new pair of Nikes, gleaming and fresh, not for the material aspect, but because I know the comforts they will bring me from day one until the soles are worn.
          They say that when kids hit a certain age, they fight with their parents about anything and everything they can, well, when I got there, my parents started fighting with me about anything and anything they could. My opinion is wrong and lacks logic, when to me it makes perfect sense. I am too sorry all the time, ""I'm sorry"" is all I ever say and apparently apologizing is unacceptable. Staying up late to finish homework after practice is not allowed. And not to mention all the times I intentionally look for ways to agitate my mother. Yes, that one time I wrote too small on a shopping list, man I got her good. 
          So at times like that, I turned to what I knew would never yell for things that no rhyme or reason to them whatsoever. I went outside and dribbled a ball or got on a bike, I hit a volleyball or I walked the dog. There was solace in the rhythm of the ball, my steps on the pavement, or each cycle of the tire. The place of refuge that I needed from these things was not where I went, but in what took me there, because even if I had no displacement, since I always ended up back home anyway, I felt better because of what I did in those shoes.
          Some people can rely on their family, but when things get shaky I turn to my sneakers to help me persevere and formulate a solution. Truth is, sometimes you're thrown a curveball, and sometimes you have a wide—open layup. The trick is to be able to come out on top for both situations and any other in-between, and sometimes it can't be done alone. I've looked to my sneakers to lead the way, and I think so far I've done alright for myself. Although things get rocky, I always keep going, and I am very lucky to have a good pair of sneakers to keep me company. 
          I never had the best relationship with my parents, and quite honestly I see no change in the future. But the one solid thing they did for me was that they allowed me to play sports from the beginning, and without that I would not have realized the comfort I find in sneakers. At least, I would not have found it so early. Even though I am going far from Ringwood for college, I know that as long as I have a pair of shoes that I can run, jump, shoot, and bike in, I'll be okay. The lessons I have learned, values I have, and lifestyle I have developed is all owed to a pair of fresh kicks.

098842.txt,Kelly,,,"Burnsville, Minnesota","May 12, 2011",2011,Comfort in Uncertainty,education & knowledge;faith & religion,"Two things that have really influenced the way I think about religiousness and spirituality is the different ways of knowing and types of religiousness. As I've grown, I've been more and more skeptical and curious about basically everything I've learned and observed. When I was a kid, I was raised a Lutheran. When I went to church and confirmation classes, I thought of it as a lesson that I was supposed to take in and memorize. I'd never really felt a deep connection with what the pastor taught, but I just accepted it as what was true because that's how I thought I was supposed to go about it. 
As time went on, I became curious and unsure about my ""faith"". I thought this was a bad thing. Whenever I'd question things, my family and friends would give me a worried look and and make me feel as if discussing other sides of faith was wrong. As I grew older and into my own person, I realized that being skeptical and having a ""quest"" based approach to learning is actually a good thing. I feel like there is no way you can know anything with absolute certainty, especially when it comes to religion and spirituality. The worst thing I could do was just accept what was placed in my head by authority figures and not question it or think about it. Intuition and personal experience may give some guidance on things, but to me, it's just not enough. The only intuition and personal experience that I find solid enough is the idea that I don't know anything.  I think that science and reasoning can answer a lot of questions, but in the process, it also creates so many more. I find comfort in the idea that I'm not certain about my faith. It just gives me time to explore and learn. Right now, I don't know if I'll ever find out that absolute truth, but the good part is the quest to find it.

No one wanted me on the team, but I told them, ""I don't care.""
Every day of practice I got thrown down. So one day I decided to quit. But my dad encouraged me to keep playing football, so I kept playing.
It was the first game; it was around 105 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit. We were down by 7 and all I could think about was winning because we did not want to lose on the first game. We won! The reason we won was because the coach put me in and I always got the runner. This time when I tackled him, he fumbled and we got a touchdown. The whole year we went undefeated. 
I believe that a lot of kids should play because it's fun and active.

099804.txt,Ryan,,Under 18,"Houston, Texas","May 24, 2011",2011,With Open Arms,good & evil;goodness & kindness,"People imagine the world to be a place of wonder and majesty. They expect when traveling into a different country to be welcomed with open arms. 
Yet, for those who have attempted to test these beliefs on purpose or not, the results haven't always been pleasing. Some are exposed sooner than others to the ""ugly truth"": the truth that people are selfish. People do what they do for themselves. People do what they do for money. And people do what they do to take themselves one step closer to what they believe is happiness. 
My own personal example of this began eight years ago on the spring break of 2003. I had recently arrived in New York for a cruise from Canada to Florida.
After living in a neighborhood in which the air was relatively clean, my lungs tried to reject the toxic air of New York City. Even when sounding like Darth Vader I tried to enjoy my one and only visit to the legendary city that was oh so not impressive. 
But the bad air was not the worst thing to happen to me there. It was in New York City that I experienced human selfishness truly in action.
While walking down the street I noticed a bright woman, and I mean that literally. She had on a yellow dress that shined as if the sun wasn't hidden by clouds and smog. A stroller rested gently under her right arm as she patted her stomach which looked about seven months pregnant.
I'm sure you have heard the expression ""when something seems too good to be true it probably is"". I'll just verify it for you. 
The woman wasn't paying much attention, and began to move down the sidewalk. She began moving at full pace, not noticing that a strap of sorts was stuck under the stroller's wheel. Almost immediately she lost balance and tripped. 
As she fell I watched in horror. Thankfully, she didn't take the stroller with her. Landing on her knees she quickly moved her arms to keep from hitting the ground at full force. However, she only managed to keep herself from landing on her stomach and injuring her unborn baby.
This is no happy ending though. Even as she fell, landed, and lay helpless on the sidewalk no one came to her aid. People hurried by and barely glanced in her direction as she struggled to get up. They acted as if she was not a stranded pregnant lady but a small construction site to be avoided.
Throughout the many years that have passed since this small yet significant event in my life, I have come to realize there is only one possible explanation for the reaction of the indifferent bystanders. People don't care. 
I believe in embracing people, caring about them, and showing them that the world isn't as selfish as they think.
In this I believe. Try it.

100026.txt,Nehad,,Under 18,"Yucaipa, California","May 25, 2011",2011,Life Through a Pencil,creativity;self-knowledge,"I have a lot of skills to be thankful for, but my favorite skill is drawing. Drawing is my life and I practically do it every day. Drawing is like an escape from the real world and real life problems. It can be relaxing, fun, and entertaining. All drawing is, is basically using your pencil in your hand and letting your hand go to make whatever it pleases. In a way drawing is kind of like a flower. A flower is tall, relaxed, and fragrant. Drawing is like a tall, relaxed, and colorful flower that you have to have patience in doing. 
I really love to draw and I have been drawing ever since I have been able to hold a pencil in my hand. Drawing is a good way for me to let all of my emotions pour out on paper. It is not a violent or wrong way to let out my emotions, but other people think it is an unacceptable way to let out their emotions. What I say is would you rather have your kid letting out their emotions through paper or would you rather have your kid beat on someone else to let the emotions out.
When I draw, I am in the process of letting out my emotions weather I am angry and depressed or happy and calm my drawings will show what emotion I have. Like one time I was angry because my dad and I got into an argument about my grades. I ran upstairs, slammed the door and just sat down. After a while I pulled out a piece of paper and a pen and started to draw. What I ended up with was a picture of a house burning down and people in fear. I do not call myself a violent person; I do not call it violence. I think that I was letting out my emotions in a non- physically violent way. Another time is when I was really happy and excited that I was finally getting my license for driving. After I came home I went to my desk, started drawing and ended up with a happy, peaceful scene by a river. 
Drawing is basically one of the ways to self express myself as well as others. I am not saying you have to pick drawing as one way to self express or let out your emotions, but realize that it is one of the non violent ways to do so. So get up, grab a pencil and let your life run through your pencil onto the paper.

100111.txt,Patrick,,Under 18,"Guangzhou, other China","May 26, 2011",2011,Love the Life You Live,gratitude,"I grew up in an international community; I have a great school and a great family. Since I was a little kid I've always received what I wanted, I never had to do chores to earn allowance, and I never had to get an ""A"" in school for my parents to buy me something I wanted. My dad always told me that in the outside world, not everyone is as lucky as I am; there are people with no family, no food, and no home. He always taught me to love the life I have. I believe in what he taught me.
When I was a kid I would come home from school, sit at the dinner table and tell my dad about all the new games my friend's parents bought them, complaining about the amount of shirts or games I had compared to my friends. I always compared myself to kids who I thought had more advantages than me, kids whose parents spoiled them. Still I never actually compared myself to people who were not as lucky as me.
I remember a few years ago, when I was around 13, on a Friday afternoon I was walking home from the metro station after school, just like every other day, but that day it wasn't the same. That day was a day that changed my life. 
On my way home I saw an old lady. She looked like she was in her 70s, and she was picking through a trash can looking for empty bottles. Her plain white hair was tied back with a thick rubber band, she had a black plastic bag on her back. She emptied out the bottles and threw them into her black plastic bag. When I walked passed her she looked at me, and she smiled. She didn't have the prettiest dress or the fanciest shoes but it was one of the sweetest smiles I've ever seen. I could see a sense of happiness in her smile. The smile on her face showed me that the way I live didn't matter, as long as I am alive I should cherish every second of life and appreciate what I have.
At that time her smile reminded me of the words my dad said to me once. ""Love the life you live"" and then there was a sense of guilt after remembering the complaints I made to my dad, and it was then that I realized how lucky I was. It was a smile that I would remember for the rest of my life.
I still believe in what my dad taught me, and I think I always will. This belief not only changed my way of viewing the world, but most importantly it changed the way I am as a human being. It made me want to become a better person, and it made me appreciate every moment I have.
I believe that I should always cherish the life I was given, no matter where I am or how successful I am. I believe in what my dad taught me. This I believe.

100426.txt,Kevin,,,"Vista, California","May 31, 2011",2011,Friends,brotherhood & friendship;gratitude;self-knowledge,"I believe that having a variety of friends has strengthened my character.
Throughout my early childhood years, I felt somewhat of a connection with the rest of my family members, and felt as if I had a relatively normal family. However, at some point a few years ago, the enjoyable experiences with my family started to gradually disappear and relationships became more distant. Because of the lack of strong relationships, I could think of many other things I'd rather be doing than being home, like being with my friends. 
I have had many different friends throughout my childhood, some influential in good ways, and some in not so good ways. However, I believe that the negative qualities are just as important as the positive qualities in shaping one's character. By surrounding myself with a variety of people with different ways of life, I feel like I've learned a lot about who I want to be. I'm glad to say that the negative impacts of some of my friends haven't greatly affected me in any way, and from this I have learned what person I don't want to be.
More times than not I would say my friends have had a positive impact on me. My closest friends are the people I know I can go to for any problem. I have come to realize that without these people, my life would be so much more difficult. I have been through many ups and downs with them, but I know that they are true friends who will always be honest with me and will always be there for me. I think of these friends as my own family. 
Then there are the not as close friends, who probably aren't as close because we don't share a strong common bond, but they still have just as great of an effect on me. These are the friends that have different interests than me and have different opinions on things. I have come to appreciate these people for showing me things in a different perspective and they have helped me become more open minded with things.
I have enjoyed the many friendships throughout my life, whether they have been close friends or merely acquaintances. These people have made me more well-rounded, and I don't know what I would do without them.

100510.txt,Jacob,,,"Londonderry, New Hampshire","June 1, 2011",2011,The Universal Language,music,"It's almost too simple to describe. As of right now I'm listening to a song I've never heard before but I feel such an unimaginable connection to it it's scary. Some may say that music is just a combination of sounds, melodies, and rhythms, though it's so much more and can have the power to wound, heal, tear down, and build back up again. No one human being can contemplate their life and other's lives without relating it to music, considering the 60's and 70's where all revolution was based around the message of music at the time.  Whether we know it or not, our lives are constructed around lines of musical notes and chords. Any great art has the power to influence the world, and I believe that music is the strongest of these art forms and can drastically change anything on this earth. 
""You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope some day you will join us, and the world will live as one."" These words sung by John Lennon stretched their arms to envelope the entire globe. Because of The Beatles popularity, they were able to spread their messages to anyone that wanted to listen. Imagine if we all obtained this power: to balance the world peacefully through sounds. This type of protest and outreach is almost uncanny and hardly any of us are able imagine it, though it's not just a random thought. All of us can acquire this power or can benefit from it in some way. Revolutions of thousands were created just because of songs and corrected so many wrongs over the years including slavery while African Americans hid secret messages in their songs. From these movements to the flower children's uprising in the 60's and 70's to gain political voice and peace, music has shown us it's power and ability to conquer anything we throw at it or each other. 
Music also has the power to bring light to the darkness, hope to the hopeless, and peace to the restless during the lowest and most unexpected times in their lives.  I've witnessed tears streaming from people's faces with their arms outstretched as far as they could into the air all because of one line of a song played from a Christian band. This may seem unbelievable and slightly exaggerated, yet these people felt the greatest amount of faith and even the presence of God through these so called sounds, melodies, and rhythms. It's hard to deny the power of music when it's showing itself right in front of you while bringing peace through people's hearts. Again, imagine this effect on an entire nation. 
Without music, I believe that is world would be absolute chaos. It balances all of us in a way that's somewhat unnoticeable as it enters you, but when it comes out in your actions, words, and emotion; it can't go unrecognized. Music is the one thing in this chaotic, corrupted, and violent world that makes sense now and we can't afford to ignore every message it holds in between every line of notes.  We have the power to change the world and how we live to create a peaceful and perfect environment, but only if we listen.

100694.txt,Brandy,,,"Sun Valley, Nevada","June 2, 2011",2011,I'm Sorry,forgiveness,"""I'm sorry!"" This is a very powerful statement. There are so many times that I ask myself if people know just how strong those words are and how much impact they have on the people around them. On February 2, 2011, I lost someone very dear to me and the only two words people could seem to utter were ""I'm sorry"" and whether they realize it or not, it truly meant a great deal to me. Those two simple words managed to help me make it through the terrible loss I suffered. 
""I'm sorry"" is not just a nice way to surrender when you have done something wrong, but instead a way to express that things will improve over a period of time. It shows others that you know times are tough and that they will make it through difficult times. ""I'm sorry"" is the first thing people say when they are at a loss for words when things go wrong. When telling someone something traumatic, sometimes the only response given is ""I'm sorry."" Although the response is short, it still makes one glow a little on the inside; at least is does for me.
""I'm sorry"" is a motivational saying that lets people know you understand them. It not only lets them know you were listening to them, but that you feel compassion towards them. ""I'm sorry"" are two of the strongest words people can say to other people that want to feel better and are prevented from doing so. The words are not just words; they are words that have an important statement to express.
""I'm sorry"" has helped me in more ways than one, ranging from just making it through a rough day to overcoming the loss of a loved one. ""I'm sorry"" has even helped for all the things in the middle like losing my wallet or someone bumping into me in the crowded halls. If there is a set of words that should be appreciated much more than they are, it should be ""I'm sorry."" 
I know in my heart people underestimate the power of the two overly used words of ""I'm sorry"". However, the powerful punch the short little statement consists of needs to be expressed. It is crazy to think just two piddling words can brighten even the worst of days. Do not allow for those couple of words to become habitual, make them pack a mean punch. ""I'm sorry"" is so powerful, it is like the cup of coffee that brightens the unwanted early morning.

Nobody is promised wealth or happiness or even to be born with good health.  We will all cry, deal with death, disappointment, heartache and pain, I also choose to believe that time will heal all wounds. Life isn't fair, it isn't easy, and you will be faced with obstacles that will make you want to give up. But I believe in perseverance. I believe in falling 7 times and getting up 8.
I believe in grace under pressure. I believe in showing the world you have a thousand reasons to smile when it gives you a hundred reasons to cry. I believe true strength is holding it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart.
I believe you have two choices in life; either you let the things that happen to you make you or break you. Two years ago I let life break me. I had lost everything due to ignorant choices I decided to make and was left with no place to go and no one to reach out to – I had burned all my bridges. I was lost with no sense of direction- maybe I always had been and maybe I still am; it doesn't really matter I guess, either way I had reached rock bottom. 
        Two days being homeless and a stomachache later, I guess I had what some would call an epitome (I call it God) – I realized there was only one way you can go when you're at the bottom… UP. I almost failed to appreciate the beauty in failing so badly – failure was no longer an option I had. The only thing that separates the weak from the strong is what one decides to do in times of downfall. The weak lay down and give up while the strong keeping pushing. If I didn't believe in anything else I believed and still do that I had to overcome. I would not allow life to get the last laugh and I believe no one else should either. 
I believe that in every difficulty comes opportunity. That sometimes the best thing you can do is let go and let God, and every situation we come across in our lives shapes us into who we are meant to be. Blaming the situations that life throws at you for who your turned out to be is a sign of weakness. I believe everyone should choose strength. I believe the only real failure in life comes from not getting back up when you're knocked down. I believe that defeat should make you stronger. So, go ahead… fail, cry, hit rock bottom, get back up and do it all over again, because it's never the amount of times you fall down that matters it's the number of times you get back up – this I believe.

I've heard great stories about Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Buddy Holly, the great Jimmy Hendrix, and many more inspiring artists of our past, and it seems to me that music today is fake! It seems like music has been ""hacked,"" in a sense, because we have all of this technology that makes us able to artificially ""sing.""
About a year ago, when I was first introduced to auto-tuning, I thought it was funny and kind of cool. My friend approached me and said, ""Dude, check this out! I found an app on my ipod…it's called auto-tuning."" 
Later on, I realized that new artists are using it in their music. It sounds robotic. I remember thinking, ""Can this really be? Is this what music is coming to?"" I was very disappointed that musicians were cheating their way into fame and fortune. What ever happened to real talent?
Auto-tuning makes you sound perfectly on key when you sing by changing or altering the pitch of your voice to a note that is appropriate. Musicians still use this today, often to make artist's voices sound flawless. But back when the Beatles were around, none of that was even invented. My mother always loved the Beatles and Elvis Presley so when she hears today's music compared to older music, she can tell that there's a huge difference. She believes that auto-tuning is not needed.
The bands in the past had to record their music without any pitch changers or auto-tuners. It was all pure! They recorded it over and over again until they got it the way they liked it. Sure, it was a royal pain, but it was all real talent. Real. That is what makes a musician a musician. Earning your way to the top, by working your rear end off and practicing to the point where you are noticed for your extreme skills. A musician is looked up to. Anyone can use auto-tune.
I'm a musician, and I perform/record all of the time. I have my own recording gear. When I record it's the old fashioned way. No auto-tuning! It does take a long time but it feels good when you know you actually sang it. If I ever auto-tuned my voice, I would feel guilty because it wasn't really me. I would say that it feels better to sing naturally. 
Today, hip-hop music is the most mainstream. Everybody listens to hip-hop or rap. It's the new in thing. But most people just like it for the sound. No one looks deeply into it, and no one realizes that artists aren't as good as they think they are. Sometimes they can't even sing at all! It's all rigged! Some of them have money to pay for auto-tuning and some of them buy the auto-tuning gear themselves. 
Almost all the older people I talk to these days say that they miss the way music used to be. None of them want the music they grew up listening to, to disappear. I wasn't around to witness these music legends, but I sure wish I was! My parents said it was amazing being able to experience them live. My dad says that they sound perfect live. That is impressive! An artist that can perform well live, that's the real deal!
If we could pay for fame, would it still be fame? If we could buy talent, would it really be talent? If we could cheat ourselves into achieving something, did we really achieve anything? How would musicians make it big? Looks? Money? Popularity? That's not what I believe in. I believe that music is an earned skill and a God given gift, not an item that you can buy or hack! Music is a passion!

Do you remember when you were in first grade? You were probably about six or seven. Do you remember prancing through the hallways with your Rapunzel backpack strapped tightly to your back? Do you remember believing in fairy tales and magic? Thinking that you could be a princess with magical powers that could cast special spells on anyone you wished? I do. I remember being that little first grader who other kids found weird, the one who adults smiled at because they just felt bad for the kid, the kid who was oblivious to reality. I was in my own fairytale world, and I was happy. So where did this little girl go? She is still here, writing this essay, wincing at the thought of her earlier life, looking as if she just ate a bag of war heads. She is a girl who loves doing sports, being with friends, and gets good grades, while she moves slowly and invisibly through her teenage years. She still believes in fairy tales and happily ever afters, and longs to be a princess like Jasmine. Well, it isn't a secret anymore. So, hi, nice to meet you, I'm Kate, a girl who believes in fairy tales and happily ever afters and has wanted to be a princess since forever.
Who are you? A teacher, a professional athlete, a doctor? Did you once believe in fairy tales? Most readers would say yes, right? Well, if you did say yes, ask yourself where that person went? It can't be gone for good; maybe it has just been hiding for a little but will never truly leave. Believing in fairy tales is like being from a small town. Once you are from a small town, you will always be from a small town no matter where you go or how big the place you live right now is. You were a small town person once, so you will be a small town person forever. Once a believer, always a believer. So just take a deep breath, in…out…, and try to find that believer. Search your brain, be thorough and meticulous and don't leave anything out. If you can't find it, look harder; sort through your old dolls in the attic, search through diaries and photo albums, or call up a parent and ask about it. Once you find it, hold onto it and yank it to the surface. Hang on to who you are! The world constantly changes and if you get mixed in like cake batter, you will let the world change you. However, if you hold onto your princess believing days you will be an individual, oblivious to any reality. You will be happy again but this time, you will live happily ever after!

Women love to hear a good game. Even though she knows what type of guy she is looking for skin tone, hair, and eyes .
I remember I was with my friend Lara and was in high school my freshman year. She would say she's looking for a guy that's all around a nice guy to the women in his life. She did find that guy. She would tell me the nice things that he said to tell her on a normal day. 
When it comes to guys, we love eye candy. Looks good, and smell good, hair done. In college I used to hang out on the quad, were all the young people talked. I would usually hear, ""Baby, you're so pretty."" As long as you can please a woman's mind, she'll think highly of you. Guys just want the girl with the prettiest face. When she is walking around and everyone is looking at her to see who she is. 
In life, we mature as adults, and it works differently finding that person that is more compatible with us.  So women react on their feelings, and the only way those feelings occur is through the brain from the ears. Guys we base our decision on the wrong foundation. Being interested in what a female looks like instead of what's inside of her.

Still, a sub-.500 season does not diminish my love for the club. I believe that victory is only achieved through dedication.
My dad and grandfather have been Mets fans since 1962, the team's inaugural season. They would root for guys who were originally on the Brooklyn Dodgers, like Gil Hodges and Duke Snider. As a result, since my birth in 1995, I have grown up wearing T-shirts of Mike Piazza and hats from the Subway Series. At the age of 7, when I first began to follow the game seriously, I could name every player then on the Mets' roster. My favorite was Mike Piazza. I also liked Joe McEwing. Yes, I even knew Jae Weong Seo. But as a first grader, I was unable to understand the concept of losing– and the Mets lost nearly 100 games in both '03 and '04.
Eventually, my dad told me about the champion '69 Mets. For their first seven years, the team had never finished above 8th place in the league. At first, 1969 seemed like another one of those dead last seasons, until the Mets made an amazing comeback. They went 19-9 for the month of June, and then 60-30 from July to October. The Mets would later go on to win the World Series vs. the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles.
Throughout my life, I have seen the lesson of the '69 Mets hold true…
Every day in elementary school, my sister and I would beg our parents for a dog, finding every possible way to demonstrate we were mature enough to care for one. Today, we have Sophie, our Yorkshire Terrier.
Every day when I came home from middle school, my sister would have her door shut for hours, studying, even if she did not have a test the following day. Today, she attends Harvard University.
Every day in high school, I read about the Mets. Hopefully, tomorrow they will succeed. I know they will at some point, because dedication leads to success, and I will be there for every step along the way.

Every morning I wake up and realize that I am on this earth for a reason , here to redeem myself and better myself from 24 hours ago.  I believe that second chances gives  me the opportunity to live and learn, making it easier to look back on my mistakes creating a better and more simple lifestyle.  Second chances create a mental remote control in which I rewind and do something different, hoping that it can change my outcome of the future.  The words ""sorry"" or "" forgive me"" just scream give me a second chance, but sometimes words can't always change the outcomes of life or death situations.    
        Right now I look back and think to myself ""wow, I am lucky to be alive now,"" as I couldn't forget that one treacherous day when my dad decided to put me in swimming lessons at the SMC pool.  I was about 4 years old when the instructor told us to hold hands and walk towards the 6 foot end of the pool, and of course, the other kids were taller than me.  As we were walking I must have slipped and  before I knew it, my head was completely under water.  I immediately started to panic and began kicking, screaming and trying to keep my head above the water as much as possible but none of that helped. 
       After struggling for about 2 minutes my body started to get weak and I started to float closer and closer to the bottom.  Two minutes may not seem long, but it had changed my life in a instant.  As soon as I was about to hit the bottom, I felt a hand grab my arm and pull me above water.  I coughed and desperately gasped for air.  When I finally looked up, it was my dad looking down at me with a worried and astonished face.  It felt like an angel had reached down and lifted me up, giving me another chance to breathe.  
    I always remembered that day and it kept me away from pools for a while, and swimming in general.  I will forever be grateful for the second chance to live and try to swim again.  I had made the mistake of panicking while I was underwater, but was given the knowledge to not panic in situations where you may be struggling.   I believe in second chances, that everybody is created equal and that means everyone should deserve them. This is what I believe.

101790.txt,Brenda,,Under 18,"Santa Monica, California","June 20, 2011",2011,The Farm That Binds,family;place,"I believe in my great-grandparents farm. I believe in waking up at five in the morning, not because I have to, but because I want to. I want to walk down that dimly lit hallway and joyfully greet my great-grandmother who is already awake and making breakfast for the cowboys. I want to walk outside and feel that cool breeze and look up into that faint blue sky and see from the corner of my eyes the bright sun slowly rising, and thank God for another day at the farm. 
I believe that the farm can unite a family. A simple churrasco on a sunny day brings family members together that I haven't seen in months—all of us hovering around the table and talking about the latest things that happened in our lives—all of us content and worriless. There we don't talk about the bad things that have happened to us, but the good things. I remember sitting on the hammock with my arms spread apart and looking around and seeing various familiar faces, all with the same expression on their faces—happiness. To my right I see my three cousins and my little brother: Caio, Fabian, Guilherme, and Alexandre playing with a couple of cheap plastic toy cars and yet still they are as happy as ever. Straight ahead I see my father, Anderson, and my great-grandfather, Walter, barbecuing the picanha and laughing. To my left I see my great-grandmother, Zorilda, walking towards me, carrying dishes of appetizers and wearing a smile on her face. Suddenly, I feel at home. In the farm, everything is perfect to me.
I believe that the farm can teach me countless lessons. That feeling that I get when I am riding fast on a horse in the wide open green pasture. That moment when I close my eyes and feel that cool breeze and warm sun touching my face. That moment when I open my eyes and everything seems more beautiful and colorful—that moment teaches me to treasure every little instant life offers me. Feeding the chickens, milking the cows, and brushing the horses teaches me compassion. Waiting for the next morning to come when I could wake up and enjoy another day at the farm teaches me patience. And still, every day I am there, I learn something new. 
I believe in the significant lessons the farm has to offer. I believe in the union it brings to my family. I believe that the farm brings me peace and that when I am there I have no worries—only about the day I have to leave that incredible place. While I live in a big city, I am grateful and proud to call my great-grandparent's farm my second home. This I believe.

All the knowledge I got was connected in my mind with my experience and I decided that no accidents take place here on the Earth. I saw a huge system and that was a kind of life-altering thing for me. It helped me to trust life. It helped me to understand the word ""God"" in my own way. 
What I saw was a unity of all things. Amazing altogetherness. When nothing can live a separate life because that just doesn't make sense. First I concluded that from just some small things in my life, something that surrounded me and meant a lot only for me. Looking backwards at my cross-atlantic journey I clearly saw a chain of events. Everything was interconnected, everything IS interconnected and right if you have enough patience to take a wide view.
I read and heard a lot about such things as freedom is love and love is god and god is freedom and god is love. Is this one and the same thing? An unquestionable basis of everything that we just don't know how to call? At first it seemed I just was on the side of cosmos in this eternal dichotomy Cosmos vs. Chaos. But then I heard just by chance in a TV program that Cosmos was made of Chaos. It is only a hypothesis. The same as Big Bang theory. I think I didn't hear it just by chance.. I'm lead this way by this Something and Everything. By God and Love and Freedom and Cosmos and Chaos.
Whatever.

I had developed the travel bug when I served in the US navy during Korea and started on an around the world cruise the day after I reported abroad my ship.. Subsequently I took the time to visit 110 countries during my career taking pay cuts to do so. During these trips my wife and I left the normal tourists sites and hiked and trekked into the countryside to be with the locals. Our experience permitted us to experience each country in a way that the normal tourist did not. We made many world wide friends and I believe we received back far more than we gave. 
My belief was substantiated by my experience as a physician and a traveler. Each of us needs to live each day to the fullest, not delay for any reason things we think we want to do and get out there and relate to all people without judgment to race, color, creed, religious beliefs or ethnic backgrounds.

It's very hard for me to choose because all are strong beliefs. I strongly believe that sports play a big part in the classroom. I feel that sports players should be top in their classes. Athletes have to take more responsibilities than regular students. They represent our school, not only on the field, but in the classrooms as well. Without good grades, you would not be qualified for most athletic scholarships. Athletic scholarships are an easy way to save money for college. 
As you can see grades should always be put in front of sports. You will always need a backup plan just in case the sports career doesn't work out. Most high school players don't make it far playing sports, but with good grades, they can get into college and eventually they are able to get good paying jobs. The only reason they can accomplish this is because they had a backup plan, so therefore, they were able to make good money. 
Being able to play sports is an honor and a privilege and most high school students don't realize that they have.  Sports motivates students to be there best on and off the playing field.

Think of the last time you did something for someone else.  Did they say thank you, or was your kind gesture disregarded?  I believe in saying thank you.  
I used to only say thank you sometimes, but then I realized what it felt like to do something for someone else and not be thanked for it.  One example that stands out in my mind happens during volleyball.  It seems like every time I go out of my way to return another girl's lost ball they just turn back around without saying a word.  I know they are my competition, but it really makes me feel unappreciated that I do something nice for them and receive nothing in return.  These types of actions make me aware of the importance of acknowledging someone for their kind deeds.  
I have a cousin with Down syndrome, and one day I took him to the park to play.  The other kids were occupying the swings.  That upset him so I tried to distract him, but all he wanted to do was swing.  Finally, one boy noticed that Luke was waiting and offered to let him take a turn.  As we left, he turned to the other boy and stuttered out ""thank you"".  It was touching to see a kid whose life is so challenging still be able to find the value in saying thank you.
One day on the way to eat an elderly man with nothing but a map and a couple bags on his back caught my attention.  A few minutes later I was standing in line to order my food when three younger boys walked in laughing about throwing a drink on a man walking along the road.  I automatically thought of the man I had passed and I knew they had to be talking about him.  As I was leaving the man, covered in soda, was walking up to the door.  I felt bad for him while I held the door open.  As he walked by he smiled at me and said ""thank you"".  I was stunned by his kindheartedness as I watched him put his bags down and walk towards the bathroom.  I was amazed at how someone that had been so disrespected could still show gratitude towards someone else.  
Each day there are innumerable times a person could say thank you, but some do not think about all the smaller situations and the two polite words are forgotten.  For me it is easy to believe saying thank you is almost a lost art, but hearing those words in diverse situations gives me hope.  Whether it is someone being rude by not saying thank you or someone I least expect showing their appreciation, it all makes me realize how important these words truly are.  To some saying thank you means nothing, but to me being thanked really brightens my day and makes me want to continue giving.  I believe we should encourage each other to say thank you.

103269.txt,Matt,,Under 18,"Fort Collins, Colorado","September 6, 2011",2011,I Believe…,America & patriotism;freedom;patriotism,"At an early age I learned what to believe in. Still to this day I remember my beliefs. There is nothing more important than freedom. Without freedom we have no choices, no right, and no happiness in life. Freedom is necessary for happiness no matter who you are, where you are, or what time period you're in. 
One of the most common things that comes to mind when thinking of freedom is the Revolutionary War. Back in seventeen seventy six was when our great nation first gained independence, also known as freedom, from the British. The British were controlling the original colonies in such unfair ways that they started a revolution. Outnumbered by thousands they still wanted freedom so badly that they started an almost unwinnable war. Amazingly, they pulled the victory out of nowhere and gained freedom. That shows that dying and fighting in one of the harshest and most brutal wars in history is worth it to gain freedom. If dying isn't the best example of a sacrifice, then what is? Also the fact that that one of the most important wars ever was started to gain freedom shows that freedom is wanted by literally hundreds of thousands of people. It is even wanted so badly that people will give their life for it. 
The people in the original colonies were not the only group of people that needed to gain freedom. Another group that is well known for needing freedom was the slaves. People in the Americas went to Africa and captured Africans and brought them here to do vigorous work. They paid the slave little to no money and they had to live in terrible conditions while doing work all day every day. Eventually the Civil War began and ended and the slaves were finally free. The most brutal war that killed the most Americans in history happened to give slaves their freedom. But still they weren't truly free and equal until a famous man came along. His name was Martian Luther King Jr. and he gave his famous ""I have a dream speech"" to finally make African Americans truly free. They finally gained complete freedom and were truly happy once again. 
        There are still so many countries in the world today that hasn't gained freedom yet. China and Russia used to both be communist but they are now free countries. Places in the Middle East don't have complete freedom yet. In these countries men are allowed to do almost whatever they want to, but women have little to no freedom. They aren't allowed to leave their house without a man and they have to cover up ninety percent of their body. That is absolutely no freedom. It is completely unfair to the women and it sounds like a terrible way to live. Some of the women say that they like the way they are treated but they should still have a choice in what their life is like and not be slaves to their husbands. Also they don't even get to choose their own husband, who they have to spend the rest of their lives with. They need to gain freedom so they can finally be happy. 
        Freedom is a beautiful and majestic thing. With freedom comes true happiness even if the road to it involves war, pain, suffering, and many hardships but in the end it is completely worth it. Throughout history freedom has constantly been fought for all around the world. Freedom makes a person's life whole, without it they are most likely going to be miserable and live a hard life. Millions and millions of people have died just to gain freedom because freedom is worth dying for. Millions have given their life for it, so what would you do for freedom?

103632.txt,Kayla,,Under 18,"Yorkville, Illinois","September 13, 2011",2011,The Outside Cover,pleasure;popular culture,"We live in the world of technology and with this comes many changes: radio, black and white, the postal service, and good old socialization have become components of the past. Replacing them are IPads, 3D television, texting, and Facebook. Of these innovations, the replacement of the book with e-book or e-reader seems to be the most unlikely to be noticed. However, as I've come to realize in my 15 years of life, a book is not just paper and ink, but also a dream, a fork in the road, a home, and, as I stare at my personal collection of highly damaged novels, an affirmation of the struggles in the life of a teenage girl.
 When we first pick up a new book and are therefore propelled into an unknown world, it can feel a little uncomfortable and depthless as we ourselves are experiencing this outward prospective. The as we chase deeper and deeper into the ever-developing plot of this life, thrashing our way through jungles of uncertainties and dead-end alleyways, coming to understand the enclosed minds of the characters which we come to call friends, somewhere, we discover ourselves. And though it pains us to say good-bye, we close the last page, and continue on another journey into the next life. A relative structure is used to examine my own life; in the beginning years of my life, I rarely had any friends, was extremely self-conscious about my weight, height, and speech, and was constantly harassed for them. In later years, the teasing stopped, but these ideals were still being dangled in the forefront of my thoughts, and it has not been until recently that I have been redeemed from their grasp. This deliverance only occurred after reading an exceptional novel, and acquiring a new view of the outside cover. 
A child hiding underneath a thick blanket in the dead of night with a flashlight and book in hand cannot be replaced by a bright LCD screen. Opening a new book and smelling the fresh, welcoming scent of new paper and freshly printed ink cannot be duplicated by machinery. A teenager finding a life-changing novel in the dark, forgotten corner of a library cannot be replicated by bland online catalogs. A young woman rereading her favorite book remembering from the water marks and crinkled pages, when she had laughed, and when she had cried, will not be recreated by a lifeless hunk of glass and metal. Unpremeditatedly, these notions were connected in my mind, and I discovered, just as the outside cover of a book may be torn and broken, my imperfections allow me to complete task that others cannot, and they created me into who I am today. Consequently, my imperfections are imperfections no longer. 
I believe in the paperback book because its exterior completes its purpose of enlightening the reader. And just as I, and I assume thousands of other young women, the book refuses to be changed by surrounding influences. This I Believe.

103644.txt,Mary,,,"Fort Worth, Texas","September 13, 2011",2011,Beauty in the Breakdown,hope;illness,"This past summer I was treated for an eating disorder, which I can conclude after much reflection was the physical manifestation of two issues I have battled for as long as I can remember: control and perfection.
I remember my first moments on Texas Christian University's campus: a wide-eyed, believing, and confident young eighteen-year-old —impressionable, but still unstained. I loved who I was. But as the glimmer and newness of my freshman year faded, so did I. Confronted with the many unique pressures and challenges of colligate life—changing friendships, scholarship conditions, professor first impressions, long-distance parental appeasement, grade performance, image maintenance (and catch up), extracurricular participation, and more—I felt undone by the pressure to be enough. While all parts of my new world seemed to be spiraling outward, my physical body remained the one thing that was still in my control alone. 
What began as an empowering exercise of discipline and stewardship grew into a crippling obsession that could have stolen my life. Desperate to regain ownership and control, I slowly created a world that demanded all things faultless, unswerving, and precise: a toxic world that equated beauty with perfection and abhorred all things flawed and messy. 
My revelatory moment was had unexpectedly, as they usually are. Trapped in the deepest and darkest place of despair and self-loathe, I somehow found myself tucked away in the Northwoods of Wisconsin, working as an art counselor at a small Christian summer camp. I was immediately captivated by Jenna's refreshing spirit. She was clumsy, forgetful, and seemed to be just one step behind at all times: the perceivable makings of an awful camp counselor. But I could not help but observe how her clumsy steps were saturated with a freedom and confidence I hungered for. Jenna shined brightly in her messy moments because she savored the occasion to simply laugh at her shortcomings. She bravely reveled in failure and imperfection because it allowed her to repeatedly confront the reality of her human frailty with graciousness and truth. 
While my treatment and healing are far from complete, I have newly discovered the joy and freedom found in the imperfect: imperfect moments, imperfect people, and imperfect things. Thanks to the accident-prone, but wildly brave, Jenna I now believe in the healing power of the messy and the chaotic. I now believe that compelling moments of growth are found in the grey, the tangled, and the off-centered. I now believe that the crooked, the splintered, and the broken possess unmatched beauty. I believe that learning how to courageously lean into, trust, and then delight in the imperfect is what saved me. I believe in the messy. I believe that mess heals.

My mother tells me when I meet someone new .When you know which one it is, you will know what to do for that person. When someone comes to my  life for a reason, it is usually to meet a need I  had  expressed. This is why I believe that  meeting someone is not a coincidence but a plan for too  lives to meet and  help each  other. My family has been the people that know me the best help  me when I need help and pick me up when I fall. They came to assist me through a difficulty, to provide  me  with guidance and support, to aid me  physically, emotionally or spiritually.  Then, without any wrongdoing on my  part or at an inconvenient time, they  might  say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die, they walk away or  sometimes they act up and force me  to take a stand. What  I  must realize is that my  need has been met,  my  desire fulfilled, their work is done.  After their work is done they might live but their lesson will always stay in me.  The prayer I had  sent up has been answered and now it is time to move on.
This  is when I realize  people come into  my  life for a season, because my  turn has come to share, grow or learn. They bring  me an experience of peace or make me  laugh. They may teach  me  something  I had never imagine  I  would learn. They usually give me an unbelievable amount of joy, happiness and comfort . Also  life time relationships  like the one with my family teach  me  lifetime lessons  that  I  will use  every day for the rest of  my live. Things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation are constructed by your inspiration and by the people that come and give you a hand that will support you no matter what . My  job is to accept the lesson, love the teacher and apply every drop of knowledge I get thru the hours, days and years. Then when the lesson I learn during the season  is done  I stand  give a thank you to the people that stood by me during  my live lesson and hope they will keep teaching me things I don't know. This is why I believe that  meeting someone is not a coincidence but a plan for too  lives to meet and  help each  other.

104297.txt,Nathan,,Under 18,"Annapolis, Maryland","September 22, 2011",2011,Coming to Terms,self-knowledge,"""Our passions are the true phoenixes; when the old one is burnt out, a new one rises from its ashes."" – Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
The day is September 13th, 2011. My birthday. I stand in my room deep in thought, gazing into the mirror that's mounted on the back of my door. The white walls seem to reflect who I am. Just this past year, I've been thinking more about that question than I ever have. 
I know that I'm not an athlete. I'm not the most popular guy in school, and I'm certainly not a badass. So as I stand looking at that mirror, I must be there for hours just trying to think of what sets me apart from the masses. After many days of deep and puzzling thoughts, I know this. My family and friends are the closest people to me. Schoolwork before everything, and that I love to work my head in complex issues that others would steer clear of. That's the definition of someone who loves school, family, and philosophy, and there are a slew of people like that. That still doesn't make me the person I know I am. 
So what defines me? My love of history? I doubt it. Or maybe my lack of religion? Hardly. Could be the fact that I'm a gamer? Not even close. Then a thought nudges inside my head. It's my personality. My willingness to stand-up for my beliefs, my sometimes hardheadedness, my loyalty to those who care about me, my unwillingness to give up on things I care about. That's what defines me.
That same day I had that thought, I felt whole, complete somehow when I heard myself say the words, ""I am myself."" I was always told by my father that words are empty, and that action is everything. That is far from the truth. Words are everything. They can make you laugh, make you cry, make you love. They can define you even more as a person. What you say can affect your life. What you say is you in a nutshell. In the face of danger, words give hope and can make you bold. In nervousness, words can be seen through. And how you present yourselves to others with words can impact a relationship with that person. Words represent who you are.
After staring at that mirror, I learned that I don't have to be a unique and beautiful snowflake. I don't have to stand out amongst the flocks of sheep. Though it is nice to shine for a moment or two, it's better to just be who you are than wonder what impresses others. Some people are meant to dazzle. But, to be honest, I'm happy just being me. And I know this for a fact. I believe in myself.

104309.txt,Elidia,,Under 18,"Claremont, North Carolina","September 22, 2011",2011,Creativity is Key,creativity,"I believe in creativity. Without creativity, the world could not advance. We would have no way to feed our children or even be able to be typing on this computer. Creativity is what makes the human race, and the entire world, succeed.   
Creativity gives us so many things in life. Not just technical things like computers or cell phones, but it gives us happiness too. Humans strive to be different. Not different enough to be a bad thing, but different enough to be noticed. We can't do that without a little creativity. 
I look at my family and marvel at the vast amounts of creativity, for there's a lot of it in my household. I believe it started with my mother, the seamstress. She would always design and create clothing for everyone in the family. My mother just recently completed a project of hers on creating my youngest sister, Ashley, a dress she has to wear for a baby shower we are going to attend in a few days.
One day my mother got my older brother, Roger, to design a dress for me. When he was all but finished, he realized his love for drawing. Roger is absolutely incredible at art. He can see things no one else can, and only he can put it onto paper perfectly. Although Roger may not always see it, a lot of his creations end up better than what he had intended on illustrating. 
Then there's me, the amateur photographer. I realized my love for photography when the scanner was broken and my brother had asked me to take a picture of the drawing he had completed. I found myself trying for the best angle, lighting, contrast, and sharpness, even though I barely knew what any of those were. I would often take Roger's camera and go outside to photograph the trees, flowers, insects, and anything else I found interesting. Eventually, he got tired of me taking his camera without his permission and asked my parents to buy me my own. I haven't put it down since. 
The last one I want to talk about is my younger sister, Kimberly. I feel as though she got the long end of the creativity stick. She loves to draw, loves to photograph, and loves to design and sew. Her main thing, though is acting. She loves the feel of being another person, of being forced to think as someone other than herself. I find it kind of creepy when she is able to convince even her own parents that she is NOT Kimberly, but rather someone else, creepy, but insanely awesome. 
I believe that without creativity, there is no way to define ourselves or our planet. Without creativity, we are just one giant rock of boringness and gray.

Many bad things happen in life whether you choose it or not. When things bad situations come up, do you dwell on it or do you learn from it and become a stronger person? I worry and wait constantly for these bad things to happen. Things like death and sickness scare the crap out of me. How am I going to make it through these bad things? Am I going to go crazy and lose myself?
 This past summer we took my grandma to the doctor for a small procedure. We were told it went well and we could come back and speak with the doctor. After waiting twenty five minutes, another doctor came out and told us that something went wrong. The surgery caused my grandma to have a stroke and the other doctors were working on her and doing what they could. All I could think was that the person I am closest to in life could be dying. I was very shaken up at first. I thought through it for a long time in the quiet and deserted waiting room. I wasn't going crazy even though this terrible thing was happening in my life. Don't get me wrong, I was feeling terrible about this, but I knew then that I could handle whatever came to me. Finally the doctors came out and she was stable. I was finally able to breathe. Not only did this experience make me a stronger person, but it made my grandma even stronger than she was.
 I now know that next time when something bad happens like this, I will be fine and I will be able to handle myself. I will have to suffer through sadness, but I will live. It made my grandma stronger because she recovered from the stroke, and nothing is going to stop her now. Because of the stroke, she will do anything to live her life to the fullest. Everyone will overcome many obstacles in life, some worse, some not as bad, that will make us stronger than we could ever imagine.

104797.txt,Richard,,,"Tonawanda, New York","September 28, 2011",2011,Music is in Everything,music,"Without music there is no life, no living, and no human existence, this I believe.  I have believed this since the moment I started learning about what music was.  Without music, I believe, life would be a silent movie. A Silent movie without the background music. Music is in everything, from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed.  Music is in everything and everyone, everyone lives with music wither you like music or not. 
Everything I do is musical. From walking to talking, when I walk my footsteps create a beat. When I talk with someone I use my voice box which is a form of music. Everything is musical anything with sound.  Even when I'm swimming my body is creating a flow of rhythm. When doing butterfly if you don't keep your body in a constant rhythm you will slow down. Music isn't all about sound, it's also about feelings. 
If there wasn't any music everything would be dull and boring. We wouldn't be able to talk or communicate with each other. If we can't communicate there would be mass chaos and no one would listen to anyone.  We would not have a working government or anything because no one can communicate. We wouldn't be able to live because we would kill each other off.  When I'm watching TV  or playing a game the sound effects are what make it interesting. 
Without music there would be no way for anyone to express themselves. Music has a way of expressing moods and emotions. When I'm sad I play music that will make me happier. When I'm in a bad mood I play music that will make me in a better one. Music is an art, or a way to express your opinion about something. Without it I would not cry or laugh I wouldn't even care. I express my feelings through my trumpet. Without it I wouldn't know what to do or where to go. Id be lost in the world. My trumpet is what keeps me going in this world with all the hate crimes and discrimination. If there was no music I wouldn't have that escape. 
When I started out playing the trumpet I didn't know what to think.  As I continued to play it I got very fond of playing and waned to play all the time. Now I have come to love my trumpet it is my life.  It made me see the world in a whole new way. A way I never seen before in my life. My passion is now through music. I found more than some notes on a page I found what I love to do and what keeps me going to this day. That's is why music is life and life is music, this I believe.

105290.txt,Steven,,Under 18,"Groton, Massachusetts","October 4, 2011",2011,On A Hike,education & knowledge;work,"Believe it or not, I used to get a 1.6 GPA back in my freshman year. Struggling through ESL, I was put on a serious academic probation because of the poor grades. The teachers and the elders pressured me a lot. My parents once suggested me to return home for an easier education. (Well, at least an education in my first language.) I thought to myself how come the others could do better? Being in a new country sure was challenging. However, this cannot be an excuse forever. To be honest, I didn't quiet spend that much time studying in my freshman year. After knowing that I was on the edge of leaving the school. I decided to push myself a little bit harder and wait to see what happens. I started working hard and decided to not give up the chance studying abroad. I arranged a lot of extra helps with teachers in order to catch up with the classes that I didn't pay that much attention on. Also, I studied in the library, where I had never gone to before. Supervised study hours also helped me to finish work faster and in a better work rate. After a couple of weeks, the classes finally really made sense to me. I realized if I pay more attention in classes, they became easier. I would do well on tests if I started studying for them couple days before. Also, I kept revising papers that I wrote even they were optional in order to get my grades up. Procrastinating was a bad habit of mine. However, after I caught up with the work that I didn't do before, I stopped handing my homework late and started to finish them on time. The comment cards that I received later looked a lot better. Teachers noticed my change and encouraged me to keep up the good work. It was amazing realizing how the grades reflect exactly as much as the work I put in. I was happy that the hard work did paid off. My grades improved a lot and I became an honor roll student and proved to my parents that their suggestion for me to go back home was not the only solution. 
After all, I learned that me working hard and not giving up was very beneficial. I got looked down by my parents and teachers before, but now they are very happy for me. It feels really good to get the respect from them. I am really thankful for the people who supported me from the start even though I was on the downhill of my ride. I thank the teachers who still encouraged me when I was a below average student of the classes. Also, I am glad that I have gone through this experience because it can warn me every second to work harder. I believe that good things come together when you work hard and never give up.

105449.txt,Robert ,,Under 18,"Raleigh, North Carolina","October 5, 2011",2011,How I Became a Bee,self-knowledge,"¿Entiendes?, or ""Do you understand,"" is the question I was asked after almost every line of every conversation while I was in Spain for a month last summer. Little did I realize just how much I would come to understand.  If you told me a year ago that I would travel to Spain by myself and live with a family for a month, I would have thought you were crazy.  Checking in at the Charlotte airport and thinking about all the possible positive and negative outcomes of this trip, I nervously kept looking every five minutes to see if I had my passport and ticket. During the eight-hour flight on the cramped metal tube, I kept on thinking of what I was going to say when I finally got there, various beginner Spanish phrases bobbling all around my head. I figured Spain would be like Germany, which I had visited the year before.  I had the preconception that all European countries were the same and ""weird.""
Waiting on the curb to be picked up by the parents of my host family, I was energized but also very apprehensive because I did not know what they looked like. Suddenly, I was greeted by two very excited Spaniards who gave what an American would consider an overly friendly greeting — a kiss on each cheek – but for them it was nothing.  More culture shocks soon followed, such as the fact that everyone stays up until 1 or 2 in the morning and eats dinner at 9 or 10 at night. This took a while to get adjusted to. But Spanish culture is much more than the times Spaniards eat or sleep. One thing that constantly amazed me was how there is still evidence of Spanish civilization and culture from hundreds of years ago. A castle sits right in the middle of the modern city Zaragoza, for example. This was the first castle I had ever laid my eyes on, and it was jaw dropping: massive walls, a moat which is now covered in bright green grass, a garden, elaborate ceilings of all kinds, and diverse tourists milling all around it.
This trip enlightened me that foreign countries and cultures are as fascinating, if not more so, than our own. The Europeans aren't these ""weird"" socialists that some Americans think they are. European countries aren't the Third World countries as certain Americans perceive them to be. In fact, Spanish culture is, in my opinion, more rich and interesting than our own. It is much older, which means that, for example, you can find a very old castle in the middle of a modern city. My summer in Spain opened my mind to the realization that there are other interesting cultures in the world, and that life would be dull without travel and exploration of these fascinating places. 
I like to think that our world is a beehive. The countries and cultures are all the little hexagons, and the bees are travelers like me.

105528.txt,Anthony,,Under 18,"Cincinnati, Ohio","October 6, 2011",2011,Hard Work with Our Own Hands,work,"I believe in the fact that hard work done by my own hands is the most powerful thing I have.
My neighbor and myself always are competing and messing with each other just as friendly neighbors always do and I usually lend a hand if he needs if or the other way around but we usually do it ourselves, Until he cheated.
Every morning I wake up to two water falls with patios built in mine and my neighbor's yard, I built mine myself and my neighbor paid a contractor to build his. Yet his may seem all perfect and have a much more elegant look than mine I still have a better back yard. 
I have a better backyard due to the fact that when people are visiting his and they question of whom the builder was, that person assuming he is extremely talented in this field and attempting to show respect towards the wonderful work he accomplished, he has to admit that he hired a contractor. This may do absolutely nothing to affect the visitor's opinion but when they venture over to my house and say, ""Wow that's beautiful as well, who was your guys' contractor""? I just laugh at their confusion and tell them I had no such need for a contractor and did it myself with my own hands. 
This is my moment of victory and he knows, as well as I do that I have the better back yard. I know now that when I go outside I see hard work and pride next to a lot of money and a lie. Even though his may look better mine is mine, I know all the work and processes put forth and how my design was drawn up. He just knows how much he wrote a check for and what he picked out of a fancy catalogue. This is why hard work done by my own hands is the most powerful thing you have, because you take pride and ownership in something like this and other people respect that you put so much work into something. 
He never really got why people liked mine over his sometimes and I never told him my belief because I knew we were building a full out swing set/ tree house that next month for his kids. 
This play set was massive and nothing like what you can go buy from a store or even get custom made from a store that was the best part about it. We spent a solid month build this huge thing and it was a great success when we finished. 
The kids loved the thing and played on it every day. The weekend of finishing it, we had a party with a bunch of friends and they all swore that we paid a contractor to do it or that we bought a kit. These people were baffled when we showed them the blueprints of the play set. 
That's when my neighbor realized that this was so much better done by ourselves that paying someone to do it for us because we did it without any other help but our own and he knew that the most powerful thing in building something is our own hands.

105577.txt,Holly,,,"Louisville, Kentucky","October 6, 2011",2011,I Can Not Live Without My Duran Duran,music;popular culture,"I cannot remember the very first time that I heard a Duran Duran song. It had to have been when I was extremely young. I do remember getting Seven and the Ragged Tiger on cassette tape when I was five years old though. That tape got more than its fair share of play on my little pink radio. It was eventually devoured by my grandmother's car a few years later. I cried and cried for a new one, but by the time I got it, CDs were already being used. Almost 27 years have gone by, but Duran Duran still has the same affect on me that it did when I was only five years old.
Even though the 1980's decade was defined by a mirage of British, one hit wonder, pop bands, there is only one that means the world to me. Duran Duran evolved and survived to still make albums today. I believe one of the bands greatest assets is the ability to work with just about anyone in the industry to make music. Staying hip to what is going on in the business is one of the things that I love most about them. They have worked with a variety of people, such as Lou Reed, Public Enemy, and Justin Timberlake. Even with the coming and going of the original band members, every album to me is a masterpiece. Each one has its own color and flavor, though all are distinctly Duran Duran. 
I have heard that sex sells and these men did it well. I could not name another band with so many attractive members; it is hard to pick a favorite. When MTV first emerged on basic cable, image was everything. Duran Duran knew they had to sell their look to the world and they played with androgyny like it was a fluffy kitten. Scantily clad, young men, usually dripping wet with sweat or from a splash in a pool, or half naked supermodels frolicking about, had both male and female fans engaged. At a very young age, I knew there was something naughty about what I was viewing and I liked it. Some of their videos were even banned or heavily edited for American television. 
Nothing puts me into a better mood than rocking out to some Duran Duran. Sometimes, I only listen to Simon's beautiful poetry as he whispers his words in to my ears. Often when I listen only for John's bass, I can feel each chunky string being played. Nick has his synthesizer and keyboards down to a science, to where there are probably mathematicians figuring out his equations on a blackboard someplace. There are so many of their pieces put me at ease with life. I do not think I could have gotten through some of the challenges I have faced without Duran Duran's music.
I was too young to enjoy my favorite band in their prime. Even though they are not as main stream as they once were, they are still making incredible music and pioneering sound. Perhaps one day, my love for their music will pass on to my daughter. Duran Duran will always live on within me, long after I am too old to dance like Molly Ringwald in The Breakfast Club. At least now we have mp3s, that way, there is no chance of my albums getting eaten ever again.

105637.txt,Brandon,,,"Cincinnati, Ohio","October 7, 2011",2011,Jesus,,"I believe in Jesus. Jesus has been there in my life in many ways I have failed to realize. Jesus has given me loving parents, a warm house I can come to every night, clothes, and being able to wake up every day and enjoy life. 
When I was younger, I didn't really know what or who Jesus really was. I was taught that he died on the cross for our sins. But while I am at LaSalle I had gained more knowledge of who Jesus really was, by his miracle performing and by his actions that he had done for us just so we can be here today. 
One example of why I believe in Jesus is when my grandfather had a heart attack around 5 years ago, and I remember being at my grandmother's house watching her pray and watch the whole family pray. We were not sure he was going to make it or not. But he is alive and doing well today. I thank Jesus for that.
Another thing is why i believe in Jesus because of what he did to my dad. One day my dad had called my whole family into the living room. We had no idea about what he was going to say. He looked at us and said I might be going into the war. I was devastated. I did not know what to do or what to say. I ran outside and cried. Ive never cried so hard in my life. I spent about 10 minutes straight crying shouting out to god, asking him why would he do this. I went back into the house and he wanted to keep talking to us about it but Ive already heard all i needed to hear. So i went into my room and started praying to Jesus. I prayed for about 2 weeks straight and one day my prayers were answered. My dad told me in the car that he did not have to go into the war because his paper work had gotten messed up. 
These a only a few reasons why Jesus is the biggest part of my life. This I believe.

105674.txt,Clare,,,"San Diego, California","October 7, 2011",2011,"Truth, Fairness, Justice",,"I believe in justice of all kind. Justice to me is the truth and fairness, whether it benefits ""you"" or not. The truth and fairness, which is justice, comes in all shapes and forms and affects all walks of life. 
My experience with justice has been scary. My experience involves my best friend who was wrongfully arrested and convicted for something he had not done. For justice to be done, he needed my help. Now, helping serve justice in this case is not as easy as it sounds. My best friend is not liked much by the police, sheriffs, DEA, you name it they don't like him. Even though he had not gotten in trouble for seven years, they do not like him for prior events when he was younger.  Since I am his best friend, they also do not like me. I was told by we'll say the sheriffs, that if I have contact with him in any way or help him in any way, I would get in trouble. This put me in a tough bind. I disregarded what they had told me and found myself in trouble. 
My car got impounded, two times, I got taken to jail, two times and was still receiving threats that I should not have any contact with him or I will get in more trouble. How much more could they do? How much more trouble could I get in? I haven't done anything wrong, why should I get in trouble? But, at the same time he hasn't done anything wrong either? Why should he be in trouble? Is that justice? When the time came, I did not speak. I did not help him. For this, I still feel guilty to this day. He will be spending twelve years in prison for something he was wrongfully convicted of. Am I the one to blame? Should I feel this guilt? Do you think this is justice? I do not feel justice has been served in this case. The truth has not been told, fairness has not been given and justice has not been served.

105922.txt,Maddi,,,"Rexburg, Idaho","October 12, 2011",2011,Santa Claus is Real,,"I believe in Santa Claus.  To most people this is a ridiculous statement, for to most people, including children, Santa Claus does not exist.  It is my personal belief that Santa is out there with the magic that he brings to Christmas.  Santa is the magic of Christmas.  I believe there is a feeling about Christmas while having family time, putting up the Christmas lights, singing Christmas carols, and then on Christmas Eve giggling with my siblings about where we think Santa is and how we need to go to sleep, for he wont come if we are awake.  
When a parent tells their child that Santa does not exist, what would their Christmas Eve be like? They would read Christmas stories, but not believe in them.  They would listen to Christmas carols, but they would not feel the magic.  They would watch as other children throw carrots out on their lawn for the reindeer, but simply point and laugh.  There is no excitement on Christmas Eve, for they know that their parents went out and bought their gifts.  They do not believe there is a jolly man headed toward their house on a sleigh pulled by reindeer.  If one does not believe in Santa, there is simply no magic about Christmas anymore.  
As I said before, Santa is the magic of Christmas.  Christmas Eve is about doing all of these things with excitement in your heart.  I love feeling the certain feeling that Christmas gives me, mostly because I still believe, I do have that excitement in my heart.  I know when Christmas is coming because I can feel it while listening to Christmas carols, putting the Christmas lights up on the roof, decorating our Christmas tree, watching Christmas movies, and preparing a Christmas meal with my mother. Watching Santa Claus and reading ""T'was The Night Before Christmas"" every year, it makes me and my sisters get all excited, just knowing that the reindeer would eat the carrots on our lawn and Santa would eat the cookies we took all day Christmas Eve making.  Sometimes before I fell asleep I would listen to a clatter on the roof, for maybe he had come early this year.  As in the book Polar Express, a little boy received a bell off of one of the reindeer gear, which played the most beautiful sound.  When he showed his parents Christmas morning, they found the bell to be broken, for they could not hear the beautiful notes because they had lost their belief in Santa.  But as for me, I still hear the bell.

105944.txt,Ridge,,,"Braselton, Georgia","October 13, 2011",2011,The Good Fight,education & knowledge;family;legacy,"""When you come to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on."" I attempt to apply this quote from Franklin D. Roosevelt to every aspect of my life. I consider myself a very strong and persevering person. These attributes came to me through a lesson taught by my dying great-grandmother. In January of 2010, the person I loved most in this world was taken from me. Addie ""Nanny""  passed away after walking on God's green earth for ninety-three years. She was, and still is, the most influential person in my life. 
Over the years, especially in the summer months, I was privileged enough to sit in her living room and watch Bob B on ""The Price is Right,"" as well as take in all the words of wisdom she offered. Up until a month before the doctors gave us the news, she was cooking spaghetti for the entire family, and working in the garden. 
Tears were not shed when mom told me that the doctors had found the disease. I held them back when Nanny calmly said ""I got the cancer son."" I put on a smile when we shared what would be our last Christmas together, and I didn't cry when the morphine took away her memory of me. 
My breaking point came about a week before she died. She hadn't spoken in over two weeks, but one night, she looked up at my uncle and uttered one solitary word. ""Happy."" Tears streamed down my face, and in that one word, she taught me one extremely important lesson. After all she had been through, the doctor's telling her she was too old for treatment, realizing that the medicine she was taking literally made her lose her mind, knowing that the end was so near. The word she chose was one of joy, and peace of mind. 
Her strength wasn't physical. She wasn't strong from lifting weights at the gym. Her perseverance didn't come from running marathons. The strength she had came from God, and the undying love she had for her family. Her trials made me strong. Her endurance taught me to persevere. She fought the good fight, and taught me to do the same.

106081.txt,Kaitlyn,,Under 18,"La Grange, Kentucky","October 14, 2011",2011,Truly Becoming of Me,love;self-knowledge;tolerance,"A wise and very attractive nerd named Charlie McDonnell once sang, ""You need to be able to love yourself."" and these are words I have taken as an important piece of my life. 
I have realized I have to live in my body, mind, and spirit my whole life, so why the hell should I hate myself? As a sophomore in high school, I have enough hate pestering me in this concrete box of hallways and awkward make-out sessions. It's obviously fair enough to love myself for who I am.
For some reason, humans have this idea in their cute little minds that tells them, ""LOOK, SO-AND-SO HAS A QUIRK! GO MAKE FUN OF THEM!"" This was the case between me and a former friend who was never much of a friend. What sucks about being bullied by a former friend is that they know what makes you tick. Of course it made me feel like hitting my head against a wall, but I had to remember that whatever she said was wrong. I am myself, and I love who I am! However, sometimes, I'd felt she wouldn't accept me if I was my own way. So, I adjusted, not thinking about it. Then, as I grew, I began to realize that I wasn't my own. I had to fix that. Honestly, if I had less anxiety, I would tell her one thing: she ruined my life, but I have learned so much from it, and that, I thank her for.
Someone I look up to very much has also shown me what it means, in the long run, to love yourself. My mother has gone through a divorce, and it hit her way harder than us kids. However, over time, she gained independence and pride out of herself. She knows now that she can be who she is and not who she is told to, seeing as she felt she needed to be someone else. She was strong and she achieved being who she was after the divorce. That was all she wanted, anyhow.
In the song ""Still Fighting It"" by Ben Folds, he mentions that it sucks to grow up. He wasn't lying: growing up comes with tasks to achieve, like gaining independence or seeing the world as something other than a playground. The sad truth in growing up is that nobody will hold my hand to cross the road. Nobody can pick my clothes or tell me to wipe the dirt off of my pants; I must figure that out myself. I've gained this knowledge through myself and time as it passes. Loving myself has shown me how to grow and move on, and it's vital to my life as I kick the door open to embrace the world.
""Our relationship is complicated./ Sometimes, it's hard to remember/ that you're even there."" This song taught me so much. Yes, it is complicated to be loving of myself, but what I find myself asking this as I think of all the possibilities: What if I were to lock myself in a room with nobody else for a year? I can't survive if I hate myself. I am vital to MY existence, or else, I wouldn't exist.

Lately this thought has crossed my mind many times. I may end up ordering a custom bumper sticker with this phrase and placing it on my car…
As a collection of people that share a common geographic border with Canada and Mexico, sometimes I think that's about all that we have in common today. It seems we've all settled into groups, either by choice or by inaction,  that have weak ties to a larger America. You name it – city or suburban, Black, White, Latino or Asian, Tea Party or Liberal, rich or poor, etc… distinct groups with polarizing agendas abound. And, with the constant streams of segmented and biased media beaming at us from all angles, we each can get our ""feed"" to support our positions, regardless of what the actual truth or facts may be.
As Americans, we share a common history that makes us uniquely American. This includes the strong individualism shown by the settlers and by those that later moved West. We also share a history of entrepreneurism and capitalism, and a strong work ethic, seeking better lives for our families and future generations. This history was an undercurrent that tied most of us together, and indeed ""united"" us.
Now, compared to earlier times, things are indeed different. We are quickly becoming a nation of ""minority majorities"", with various ethnic and cultural backgrounds and experiences. The world is seemingly much smaller, as competition for business comes from all points around the world. And an Internet connection can be the difference between total isolation and total connection. Finally, with the stress brought on all of us from this prolonged economic recovery, we're hearing more conversations about our country having reached its peak…
For today's America, I believe the value of a common community is essential to our restoring our sense of unity and common purpose. To me, community means that first, we are all Americans, and we work to set aside differences and search for common ground. Community includes that an inner city child struggling in school, or an elderly woman needing help living in a rural area. Both are worthy of attention and aid ideally coming from a blend of public and private sources. Community also contains an aspect of personal accountability. That together, we succeed or fail as Americans, and that each of us should strive to improve ourselves and others around us. 
So, ""What unites U.S.?"" I believe it's a stronger sense of common community, which can help guide us towards better lives, both for now and for future times.

I believe that nobody should be ashamed to be themselves, and everybody should accept each other for who they are.
When I began preschool, I started noticing the judgmental people, the one's who made people cry because they made fun of the drawing or told you your favorite game is stupid. To this day I'm still being surrounded by their negetive energy. For much of my time growing up, I got put down, made fun of, critisized, got my feelings hurt, and also watched all of those tings happen to my peers.
I think that everybody has unique personality that makes us who we are, and no one has room to judge one another. Every single one of us have flaws and something that people could critisize.
Watching my own friends and peers be judged and make judgments on people because of the way they look is unacceptable to me. I believe that we are all wonderful human beings who deserve to be respected for being ourselves.
Therefore, it's our own personal decision to make fun of someone or hurt their feelings. Growing up we all heard the saying ""Treat people how you want to be treated"" and that's exactly what we should do. Nobody wants to be self-conscous of who they are or restrict themselves from being their own person, so we shouldn't make anybody feel that way if we don't want to feel like that.
I personally think that people should truly be proud of who they are no matter what. We all have different characteristics and perspectives that make us different from one another. Nobody should feel like a ""loser"" because someone who is supposedly ""cool"" gave them a dirty look or put them down.
Not only growing up with hurtful people, but now going to school with hundreds of hormonal and judgmental people I've realized that putting someone down can have several effects. I have witnessed multiple people cry because of rude remarks based on skin color, the clothes you wear, the people you hang out with, your interests, ammount of money you have,and how popular you are. Many teenagers cut themselves because of harsh comments made about their lifestyle, not to mention 1 out of 12 teens attempt to commit suicide.  
Next time you're going to make a judgment of someone you don't know, remember that they have feelings just like you, so treat them how you want to be treated.

But, I do believe you can use what has happened in your past to make a happy future.
My dad was a drug addict and is an alcoholic. I remember going to AA meetings and watching him go through detox, it made me very depressed. It's hard to watch someone you love go through something like that, it is hard to watch and understand. I was always checking on him to make sure he was doing okay. But, no matter how hard I would try he would always relapse. I have to say the worst feeling is knowing that after all that energy you spent go down the drain. 
I literally felt like I had to stop my life, so my dad could go forward in his. People would always tell me that I needed to ""think about myself"" or ""move on"", but how can as a daughter let her father ruinv his life to this horrible things. How could I live with myself knowing that I did not even try to help.  For me I could not, it just was not possible. I could not sleep, eat, focus, nothing, all I wanted to do was make my dad better.
Then I'm not sure what happened but I woke up and realized that everyone was right. I did need to focus on myself, and the only way I could help my dad was by loving him and being there for him when he needed me.
Now, of course I will always be there for my dad no matter and I love him with all my heart, but I need to make myself happy first. I have used what I have gone through to make my life better. I am going to school to become a nurse, and then I plan on helping recovering drug addicts and alcoholics better their lives.

Ever since I've been a little girl, my church family has always said that God made me who I am for a reason. They've always said that he created me in my mother's womb with a purpose for a great life of Him. Then once I left my mother, He would guide my every step to my purpose for the greater good that he gave to me and me alone. 
When Fourth and Fifth grade came along, many of my friends began to see changes in themselves and my girlfriends found the 'magical' substance called make-up. They'd start wearing it, mostly just around the eyes, attracting any guy who paid enough attention. My belief, though, stayed strong, He had made me this way and that's not going to change. 
Then Middle School came around, and hair products added onto all the face cover ups. The straightener was the most popular, but I cringed at the thought of crushing my hair between two heated plates. All of my girlfriends wore make-up and did their hair in some fashion involving a straightener. All of them were Christians too, but we didn't have the same ideas. My belief, though, stayed strong, He had made me this way and that's not going to change. 
Now, in High School, I still don't wear make-up or straighten my hair, or even blow dry it for that matter. That kind of beauty that others seek can be only skin deep. Other than not changing my appearance, I believe in inner beauty. Some of the best people in my life might not be the greatest looking but they're the best friends I've ever had. Eye liner, mascara, blush, base, hair straighteners, hair dying, high lighting and low lighting are all like cover ups to me. In my eyes, if you cover up your beautiful God made face, it's like saying that you're ashamed of how He made you. Each and every one of His children was made for a reason, the way that they are. This I believe.

To mend our hearts and support her, my friends and I threw many benefits for Lorren. We had a ""Walk for Lorren"" at our local park; sold t-shirts and wrist-bands; and tried our best to keep our thoughts positive. We had full support from our community. Even though the doctors were skeptical, Lorren pushed through and stayed strong; and so did we. Kim, Lorren's mom, refused to allow us to see her; therefore, we had nothing but hope. 
After one year and five weeks of silence, Lorren had fought for her life and proved the doctor's assumptions wrong. On October 2nd, 2011, Lorren came home. Even though she is not as stable and still very weak, she is progressing. Her left arm and leg are not functioning very well, but the therapists say she will soon be capable of walking again. Her bright beautiful eyes and white pearly teeth were glowing as we all remembered her. 
When we approached her, unsure of how she would react, she knew every name, face, and memory. Kim then revealed the struggles Lorren faced. Every doctor who examined her, told Kim at least three times to be prepared for the next morning, to say her goodbyes. The thought of Lorren's life being taken away from her was sickening; making my arm hair stand up and my gut sinking to the pit of my stomach. Lorren's living proof shows not only the fight and courage in her, but the miracle that has occurred right in our hometown..
Lorren's story is not the only miracle that takes place in our small town, we all came together like I have never seen before. As one, we fought for Lorren's life with her; we stood by her side, helping her push her way to recovery, and every one of us now looks at life a little differently. Life is precious, yet fragile. Some of us fight our way into this world and some of us fight our way out, but every life given is a miracle.

107263.txt,Veronica ,,Under 18,"Arvada, Colorado","October 31, 2011",2011,Chocolate Can Cure A Broken Heart.,pleasure,"In every girl's life time they will suffer many broken hearts. It's almost like getting a cold. You know you're going to get one you just don't know when or who you will get it from. There is almost no way to avoid it. When you have a cold you take cold medicine, when you have a broken heart, you take chocolate.
   My first theory on why chocolate works so well at curing a girl's heart break, is it's amazingly sweet taste. When you are eating chocolate you forget all about the jerk that broke your heart because you are so wrapped up in the amazing taste.  Chocolate occupies your entire mind; you can't think of anything but chocolate and its yummy taste. Try it. Go home and eat some chocolate and try to think of something else.  It won't work I promise.   Chocolate taste never gets old so you never have to worry about getting sick of eating chocolate. Girls never get sick of eating it because of all the choices they have to choose from. You can eat it many ways: cookies, brownies, cake and the all time favorite ice cream. No matter how much you eat you will never get sick of chocolate.
   My last theory I have on why chocolate works so well at curing heart break is chocolate has always been there for girls. Chocolate has been curing heart break for as long as your great, great, great, great grandma can remember.  Girls have been depending on chocolate because it has  always been there. Never has a girl gone to chocolate and have it say, ""I don't want to talk to you."" It's just not what chocolate does. The only time that chocolate has ever left a girl was when the girl has run out of chocolate, and they can just go and get more.
   I know from personal experience that chocolate works so well at curing a broken heart. Last year, a lot seemed to be going wrong me. My best friend where always fighting and my parents always seemed to be mad at me. I had no one to turn to. My sister came over one day and as we were talking in the living room she got up and went into the kitchen and came back a few minuets later with a bowl of chocolate ice cream. I looked at her like she was crazy, ""What? I'm hungry!"" I remember looking at the ice cream and thinking that it was the best looking ice cream I had ever seen. ""Can I have some?"" I asked. ""Knock yourself out…"" She passed me the ice cream. It was the best ice cream I think I have ever tasted, and for a split second i forgot why I was hurt.         
   Just remember no matter how bad your heartbreak seems, chocolate is the best type of medicine.

107597.txt,Sarah,,,"Rowayton, Connecticut","November 5, 2011",2011,A Mother's Last Wishes,death;love,"My friend's mother died, and I attended the funeral at ten o'clock in the morning on a damp Tuesday in late March.   I sat alone at the end of a carved wooden pew, closest to the aisle.  The coffin had been placed in the aisle, six or eight feet away from me.  There was nothing at all between me and the box containing the dead mother.
       The church was cold; I kept my wool coat on and buttoned to the collar, my hands plunged deep into lined pockets.  I tried to pay attention to the service, but couldn't stop thinking about the body in the box. 
       Was she wearing shoes?  Why would you put shoes on a dead person?  Except that maybe clothes without shoes might look unfinished.  Would they be worn shoes?  With scuffed bottoms and that faint stain from where the mayonnaise once dripped?  Or would they be new shoes, bought posthumously by the dutiful daughter and pressed awkwardly onto unresponsive feet? 
       What is the purpose of clothing the dead, anyway?  To make them seem less unfamiliar?  I want to be done with clothes, the whole consuming problem of clothes–the tight waistbands, the underwear that should really be replaced and which style, whose style, what am I supposed to look like?
I want to be naked in my coffin.  
       Naked on white satin, under the softest white fleecy blanket pulled up far enough to cover my breasts, which have been softened by age and four long, lovely rounds of breastfeeding.
       I hope my daughter will brush my hair and lay it around me and shoo away the creepy person with the makeup.  I hope all of my children will pack me in my casket with photos of our life– pictures of when they were babies, when they blew out the candles, rode their bikes, served me breakfast in bed.  Photos of when they ran naked through the sprinkler, got the cast, the stitches, the pierced ears.  Photos of the new house, the first day of school, the Christmas tree, the concert, graduation.  Photos of the first day of college, the new girlfriend, leaving for the trip far away.  Their weddings, and even both of mine.  A photo of my parents.  I hope they'll lay in lily of the valley and common violets and lilacs and long fern fronds and handfuls of parsley from our garden.   I'd like them to retrieve all the baby teeth and first snips of hair that are hidden in the corners of my jewelry box, and before they close the casket lid, sprinkle them on top of me, and the photos, and flowers, the way we sift confectioners sugar on top of a warm cake.  I'd like to wear only the moonstone necklace my husband gave me, and my wedding ring.  Or what the hell; maybe both wedding rings.  
      Because, you know, this happened.  
      It all happened.  
      Them, me, us, love, spring.
